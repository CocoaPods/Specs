                    `KJGridLayout` is a simple grid layout manager for views in an iOS application.  

                    It can be used in a UIViewController subclass to arrange views, or can be used in the implementation of `-[UIView layoutSubviews]` in a UIView subclass.  

                    `KJGridLayoutView` is a UIView subclass which uses a `KJGridLayout` in its `-layoutSubviews` implementation. It allows one to add a subview at a particular grid position, and the grid's layout will automatically be updated whenever the view is resized or when a new subview is added.
