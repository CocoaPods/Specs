                      =========

                      CoreParse is a parsing library for Mac OS X and iOS.  It supports a wide range of grammars thanks to its shift/reduce parsing schemes.  Currently CoreParse supports SLR, LR(1) and LALR(1) parsers.

                      For full documentation see http://beelsebob.github.com/CoreParse.

                      Why Should You use CoreParse
                      ----------------------------

                      You may wonder why and/or when you should use CoreParse.  There are already a number of parsers available in the wild, why should you use this one?

                      * Compared to ParseKit:
                        * CoreParse supports more languages (LR(1) languages cover all LL(1) languages and more).  In practice, LALR(1) grammars cover most useful languages.
                        * CoreParse produces faster parsers.
                        * CoreParse parsers and tokenisers can be archived using NSKeyedArchivers to save regenerating them each time your application runs.
                        * CoreParse's parsing algorithm is not recursive, meaning it could theoretically deal with much larger hierarchies of language structure without blowing the stack.
                      * Compared to lex/yacc or flex/bison:
                        * While I have no explicitly benchmarked, I would expect parsers produced by lex/yacc or flex/bison to be faster than CoreParse ones.
                        * CoreParse does not _require_ you to compile your parser before you start (though it is recommended).
                        * CoreParse provides allows you to specify grammars right in your Objective-C source, rather than needing another language, which intermixes C/Obj-C.
                        * CoreParse does not use global state, multiple parser instances can be run in parallel (or the same parser instance can parse multiple token streams in parallel).
