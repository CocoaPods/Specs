      OCHamcrest is:
      * a library of "matcher" objects that let you declare rules for whether a
        given object matches the criteria or not;
      * a framework for writing your own matchers.
      Matchers are useful for a variety of purposes, such as UI validation. But
      they're most commonly used for writing unit tests that are expressive and
      flexible.
