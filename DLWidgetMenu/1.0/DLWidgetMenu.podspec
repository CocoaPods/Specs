                   DLWidgetMenu is a versatile solution for displaying widget menus and can easily be extended with custom layouts and/or animations

                   ## Features

                   DLWidgetMenu** comes with three built-in layouts:
                   
                   * `DLWMArcuatedLayout`
                   * `DLWMCircularLayout`
                   * `DLWMLinearLayout`
                   
                   **DLWidgetMenu** uses iOS7's **spring animations** (`DLWMSpringMenuAnimator`) by default, but can easily be provided with your own **custom animations** as well (by subclassing `DLWMMenuAnimator`).
                   
                   **DLWidgetMenu** observes its menu items for these **gesture recognizer events**:
                   
                   * single tap
                   * double tap
                   * long press
                   * pan
                   * pinch
                   
                   and **forwards them** directly to its **delegate**.
