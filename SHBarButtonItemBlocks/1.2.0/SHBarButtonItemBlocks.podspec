                    UIBarButtonItem events with blocks.
                    Blocks are hold with a weak reference so you don't have to cleanup when your object is gone.
  
                    * Swizzle and junk free
                    * No need to clean up after - The control blocks are self maintained.
                    * UIBarButtonItems are referenced in a map with weak properties
                    * Auto remove control from outlets and all actions when removing all the blocks
                    * Prefixed selectors.
                    * Minimum clutter on top of the public interface.
