                    Do segueus with blocks without any swizzling or leaks.
                    Blocks are hold with a weak reference so you don't have to cleanup when your vc is gone.
                    Also implements userInfo mutableDictionary on UIViewController
  
                    * No need to clean up after - Blocks are self maintained.
                    * Handles uninemplemented unwind segues
                    * Weak referenced blocks.
                    * No swizzling or hacks. 
                    * Name-scoped selectors.
                    * Implements userInfo on controllers without a bullshit hack.
                    * Works with existing codebase that uses old fashioned segues.
