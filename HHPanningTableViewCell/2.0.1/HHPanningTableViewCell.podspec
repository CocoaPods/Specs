                   HHPanningTableViewCell is a UITableViewCell implementing "swipe to reveal" a drawer view. Such a view typically holds action buttons applying to the current row.

This behavior is seen in a number of iOS applications. To my knowledge the idea was pioneered by Loren Brichter for Tweetie (aka Twitter for iPhone).

The HHPanningTableViewCell implementation was written for the [ACTPrinter 4.0 application](https://itunes.apple.com/app/actprinter-virtual-printer/id296083171?mt=8).
