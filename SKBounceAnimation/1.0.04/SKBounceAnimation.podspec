                    `SKBounceAnimation` is a `CAKeyframeAnimation` subclass that creates an animation for you based on start and end values and a number of bounces. It’s based on the math and technology in this blogpost: [khanlou.com/2012/01/cakeyframeanimation-make-it-bounce/](http://khanlou.com/2012/01/cakeyframeanimation-make-it-bounce/) which in turn was based partially on Matt Gallagher’s work here: [cocoawithlove.com/2008/09/parametric-acceleration-curves-in-core.html](http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/09/parametric-acceleration-curves-in-core.html).
