                    Map service responses to objects.

                    OHMKit is a mixin to make any Objective-C class easier to hydrate from a dictionary representation, such as you might get from a RESTful web service.

                    It exists because RestKit (which is awesome by the way), is too big, heavy, and indirect.

                    There is no networking layer. Use AFNetworking.
