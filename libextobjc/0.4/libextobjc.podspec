  # ChangeLog:
  # 0.3 -> 0.4
  # * This version cimes after jspahrsummers removed experimental features in 0.3 (which
  #   also caused breakage on some configurations - e.g. iOS7/64-bit)
  # * If someone requires broken or experimental features, there is an 'experimental'
  #   branch, which can be switched to manually in the normal podfile specific way
  #
  # Notes for updaters:
  # * Always refer to extobjc/extobjc.h and add (or remove!) items from subspecs_names
  #   below -- this is the list of "supported features"
  # * If and when new subspecs requires new pod dependencies, see the example inline below
  #   to add them in.

  s.description  = <<-DESC
                    The Extended Objective-C library extends the dynamism of the Objective-C programming language to support additional patterns present in other dynamic programming languages (including those that are not necessarily object-oriented).

                    libextobjc is meant to be very modular â€“ most of its classes and modules can be used with no more than one or two dependencies.
