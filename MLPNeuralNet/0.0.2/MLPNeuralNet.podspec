                   MLPNeuralNet predicts new examples by trained neural network. 
                   It is built on top of the Apple's Accelerate Framework, using vectorized 
                   operations and hardware acceleration if available.

                   Features:
                   * classification, multiclass classification and regression output;
                   * vectorized implementaion;
                   * works with double precision;
                   * multiple hidden layers or none (in that case it's same as logistic/linear regression).
