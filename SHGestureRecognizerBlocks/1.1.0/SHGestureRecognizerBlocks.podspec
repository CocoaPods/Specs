                    Gesture Recognizers with blocks.
                    Blocks are hold with a weak reference so you don't have to cleanup when your object is gone.
  
                    * Swizzle and junk free
                    * No need to clean up after - Blocks and observers are self maintained.
                    * Gestures are referenced in a hash with weak properties
                    * Auto remove gestures from view and all actions when removing all the blocks
                    * Prefixed selectors.
                    * Works with existing codebase that uses old fashioned observing delegate calls. 
                    * Minimum clutter on top of the public interface.
