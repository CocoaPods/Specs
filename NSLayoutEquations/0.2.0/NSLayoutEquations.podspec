                    Seriously: it's just y=mx+b. So why does the average NSLayoutConstraint take 200-odd characters to initialise?
                    
                    Adds two new methods:
                    * +[NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithFormula:LHS:RHS:]
                    * -[UIView constrain:to:]
                    
                    Make auto layout as simple as a sentence.
