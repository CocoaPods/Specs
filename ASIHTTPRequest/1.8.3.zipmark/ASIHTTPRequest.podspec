  s.description = %{
    ASIHTTPRequest is an easy to use wrapper around the CFNetwork API that
    makes some of the more tedious aspects of communicating with web servers
    easier. It is written in Objective-C and works in both Mac OS X and iPhone
    applications.

    It is suitable performing basic HTTP requests and interacting with
    REST-based services (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE). The included
    ASIFormDataRequest subclass makes it easy to submit POST data and files
    using multipart/form-data.
