			Location manager provides convenient and easy-to-use access to latest iOS device location. It wraps CoreLocation
			with convenient singelon class, releaving you of keeping reference to location manager object. 
			
			Main features:
			* subscribe to location updates with 3 lines of code
			* two modes of operation: GPS (accurate with low battery performance) and cell towers (inaccurate with better battery performance)
			* use CoreLocation's distance filters and accuracy modes
			* easy pause and resume on app going to background or foreground
			* instantiate location manager once, use it wherever you need by subscribing to notification
