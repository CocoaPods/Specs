                    Key Value Observing with blocks on top of NSObject.
                    Blocks are hold with a weak reference so you don't have to cleanup when your object is gone.
  
                    * No need to clean up after - Blocks and observers are self maintained.
                    * Weak referenced blocks.
                    * Prefixed selectors.
                    * Works with existing codebase that uses old fashioned observing delegate calls. 
                    * Configurable to remove the swizzled auto cleanup
                    * Remove blocks by keypaths or identifiers
                    * Remove blocks by keypaths and identifiers
                    * Minimum clutter on top of the public interface.
