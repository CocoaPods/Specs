                    Lookback is a tool and library for user experience testing
                    that you can integrate into your app. Lookback records the
                    iOS screen, the front-facing camera, microphone, metadata,
                    touches and active views, and uploads it all in
                    near-realtime to lookback.io where you can study and dive
                    into the data. Example use cases:

                  * User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your
                    testing lab to record both the screen and your tester's
                    reactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.
                  * Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of
                    using your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring
                    problems.
                  * Quality assurance. Record videos of found bugs, complete
                    with a trace of how the tester reached it.
                    
                  This version of Lookback is safe to use on the Apple AppStore,
                  but this safety has heavey performance penalties. If you just
                  want to use Lookback for video bug reports and similar
                  internally while developing your app, consider using
                  Lookback HD (the "Lookback" pod).
