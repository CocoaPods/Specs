                    SMCalloutView aims to be an exact replica of the private UICalloutView system control.

                    We all love those "bubbles" you get when clicking pins in MKMapView. But sadly, it's impossible to present this bubble-style "Callout" UI anywhere outside MKMapView. Phooey! So this class painstakingly recreates this handy control for your pleasure.
