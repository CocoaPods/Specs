  Easy to use controller that makes use of the Cocoa ServiceManagement
  APIs. This is the required way to do login items for sandboxed applications
  (required for all Mac App Store apps) and works in non-sandboxed applications
  as well.

  It's been tested on 10.7 and 10.8 (and should work on 10.6.6+). Entries set by
  this class do not appear in the Accounts Panel of System Preferences.
