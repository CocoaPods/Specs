ATMHud offers a versatile and full featured HUD for yuour iOS projects. You can use either a traditional protocol based delegate or a block based one. A Demo app shows how to use most of the feature set and both delegates. You can set any of a caption, two types of progress indicators, and an image to the HUD, which resizes as needed. You can control where the progress indicator goes (top/bot/left/right), the view grayness and cover view's grayness/opacity. If you're showing the HUD with the keyboard up (for example), you can move the HUD's center.

Usage:
    // Keep a strong ivar reference to it (ie, "ATMHud *hud")
	hud = [ATMHud new]; // using the block delegate
	[hud setCaption:@"Caption and an activity indicator."];
	[hud setActivity:YES];
	hud.blockDelegate = ....; // see demo project
	[hud showInView:self.view];
	...
	[hud hide];
	//the block delegate can release the hud and nil the ivar (see Demo app)
