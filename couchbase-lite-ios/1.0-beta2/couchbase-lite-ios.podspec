  **Couchbase Lite** is an embedded lightweight, document-oriented (NoSQL), syncable database engine.

  Latency matters a lot to users, so a local database takes frustration out of the equation. Itâ€™s got JSON documents, and the same map/reduce as Couchbase Server, in a pint-sized edition.

  Couchbase Lite compiles natively for iOS and Android. Half a megabyte optimized, for quick launch and snappy user experience on occasionally connected devices when data matters.

  **Lightweight** means:

  * Embedded: The database engine is a library linked into the app, not a separate server process.
  * Small code size: currently under 600kbytes. This is important to mobile apps, which are often downloaded over cell networks.
  * Quick startup time on relatively-slow CPUs: currently under 50ms on recent iPhones.
  * Low memory usage with typical mobile data-sets. The expectation is the number of documents will not be huge, although there may be sizable multimedia attachments.
  * "Good enough" performance with these CPUs and data-sets. (Exact figures depend on your data and application, of course.)

  **Document-oriented** means:

  * Like Couchbase Server, it stores records in flexible [JSON](http://json.org) format instead of requiring predefined schemas or normalization.
  * Records/documents can have arbitrary-sized binary attachments, like multimedia content.
  * Your application's data format can evolve over time without any need for explicit migrations.
  * Map/reduce indexing allows fast lookups without needing to use special query languages.
  * Documents can contain free-form text or geographic coordinates, which are efficiently indexed for full-text search or geo-querying.

  **[Syncable](http://syncable.org/)** means:

  * Any two copies of a database can be brought into sync via an efficient, reliable, proven REST-based [protocol][23].
  * Sync can be on-demand or continuous (with a latency of a few seconds).
  * The sync engine supports intermittent and unreliable network connections.
  * Conflicts can be detected and resolved, with app logic in full control of merging.
  * Revision trees allow for complex replication topologies, including server-to-server (for multiple data centers) and peer-to-peer, without data loss or false conflicts.

  The native APIs are Objective-C (iOS, Mac) and Java (Android), but an optional internal REST API adapter allows it to be called from other languages like JavaScript and C#, for use in apps built with PhoneGap, Titanium or MonoTouch.
