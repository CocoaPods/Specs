                    SHObjectUserInfo is a category on top of NSObject to allow userInfo dictionary without the bullshit of swizzling and other disgusting hacks. It's built on top of NSMapTable that works with weakToWeak references between an object and its userInfo. 

  
                    * No need to clean up after - userInfo are self maintained.
                    * Weak referenced blocks.
                    * No swizzling or hacks. 
                    * Name-scoped selectors.
                    * Works with existing codebase that uses userInfo dictionaries on them.
