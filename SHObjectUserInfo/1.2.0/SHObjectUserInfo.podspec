                    SHObjectUserInfo is a category on top of NSObject to allow userInfo dictionary without the swizzling. It's built on top of NSMapTable that works with weakToWeak references between an object and its userInfo.


                    * No need to clean up after - userInfo are self maintained.
                    * Weak referenced blocks.
                    * No swizzling or hacks.
                    * Name-scoped selectors.
                    * Works with existing codebase that uses userInfo dictionaries on them.
