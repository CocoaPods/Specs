                    Lookback is a tool and library for user experience testing
                    that you can integrate into your app. Lookback records the
                    iOS screen, the front-facing camera, microphone, metadata,
                    touches and active views, and uploads it all in
                    near-realtime to lookback.io where you can study and dive
                    into the data. Example use cases:

                  * User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your
                    testing lab to record both the screen and your tester's
                    reactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.
                  * Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of
                    using your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring
                    problems.
                  * Quality assurance. Record videos of found bugs, complete
                    with a trace of how the tester reached it.

                  See some more examples over at http://lookback.io/examples.
