		   RestForIOS
		   ----------
		   A lightweight and simple, easy-to-use library of static functions for accessing
		   RESTful APIs in iOS. All the methods are class methods, so functional programming
		   with this framework is a breeze, as is using these calls in background processes.
		   Connect to REST APIs in minutes (or hours?).
		   Fully documented in appledoc.
