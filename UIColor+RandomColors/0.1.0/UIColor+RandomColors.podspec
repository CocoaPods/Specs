                   A random color is sometimes useful or just plain fun, but a completely random color is rarely desired.  Instead, you might want a random but fairly dark color, or a random but fairly light color.
                   
                   UIColor+RandomColors adds a few methods to grab random colors, and to specify either a lower or upper bound on the value (the lightness or darkness) of the color.

Future potential ideas that would be great to branch from this and submit a pull request for:
                   * Set a saturation or hue bound for random colors, so you can get a random color within a slice of the spectrum.
                   * Choose a random color that matches a given color as defined by a rule such as complementary, contrasting, or triad.
