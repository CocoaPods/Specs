                   I wanted to create a game using the new Game Controller
                   support that came with iOS 7, but noticed quickly that
                   there is no quick way of doing this.

                   I decided to write a class that made it easier for me
                   to get started, and hopefully help you too!

                   I haven't really thought this through, I just wanted
                   to have something done quickly so I could start on my
                   awesome game :) Enjoy!
