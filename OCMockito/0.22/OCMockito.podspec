      OCMockito is an Objective-C implementation of Mockito, supporting creation, 
      verification and stubbing of mock objects.

      Key differences from other mocking frameworks:

      * Mock objects are always "nice," recording their calls instead of 
        throwing exceptions about unspecified invocations. This makes tests less fragile.
      * No expect-run-verify, making tests more readable. Mock objects 
        record their calls, then you verify the methods you want.
      * Verification failures are reported as unit test failures, 
        identifying specific lines instead of throwing exceptions. This makes 
        it easier to identify failures. (It also keeps the pre-iOS 5 Simulator from crashing.)
