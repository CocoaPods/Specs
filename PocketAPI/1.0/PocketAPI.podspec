                   The Pocket SDK is the fastest way to add Pocket integration to any iOS or Mac 
                   application. Adding the Pocket SDK to your app is incredibly easy. With a few 
                   lines of code, your app can quickly add support for saving URLs to users' 
                   Pocket lists.
