                    OCTotallyLazy is a framework that adds functional behaviour to 
                    Objective C collection objects, as well as a lazy collection 
                    object called Sequence. It's a partial port of Java's 
                    [TotallyLazy](http://code.google.com/p/totallylazy/).
