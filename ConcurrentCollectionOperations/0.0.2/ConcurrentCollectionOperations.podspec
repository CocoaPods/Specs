    This is a set of categories for performing concurrent map and filter
    operations on Foundation data structures, currently NSArray, NSDictionary,
    NSSet.

    Concurrency is achieved using Grand Central Dispatch's (GCD) dispatch_apply.
    By default, operations are run on the default priority global concurrent
    queue. The operations can be performed on any concurrent queue.
