                   A library to parse the apple receipt file in iOS 7 as defined here:
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateLocally.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573-CH1-SW3
                   This library does *not* handle validation -- by Apple's design, it
                   is necessary to provide your own validation code for security reasons.

                   This library *does* make it easier to fetch in-app purchase data stored
                   on the device, which could be used for server side receipt validation.
