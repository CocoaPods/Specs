                    A class to stub network requests easily:
                    * Test your apps with fake network data (stubbed from file)
                    * Use customized stubs depending on the requests
                    * Use custom response time to simulate slow network.
                    
                    > **WARNING**: This lib uses private API and is not suitable for AppStore releases.
                    > Use it only for your Unit Test targets or while in development (for example between `#ifdef DEBUG`/`#endif`).
                    > Don't forget to remove it before submitting to the AppStore.
