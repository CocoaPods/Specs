                    A class to stub network requests easily:
                    * Test your apps with fake network data (stubbed from file)
                    * Use customized stubs depending on the requests
                    * Use custom response time to simulate slow network.
                    
                    > **WARNING**: Don't forget to remove stubs before submitting to the AppStore!
                    > You should use `OHHTTPStubs` only for your Unit Test targets or while in development
                    > (for example between `#ifdef DEBUG`/`#endif`).
