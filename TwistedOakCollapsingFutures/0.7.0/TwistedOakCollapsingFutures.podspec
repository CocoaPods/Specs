                   Makes representing and consuming asynchronous results simpler.
                   
                   * Eventual results and failures are represented as a TOCFuture.
                   * Produce and control a TOCFuture with a new TOCFutureSource.
                   * Hook work-to-eventually-do onto a future using then/catch/finally methods.
                   * Chain more work onto the future results of then/catch/finally.
                   * No need to track if a TOCFuture has a result of type TOCFuture: always automatically flattened.
                   * Cancel operations on the fly by giving them a TOCCancelToken controlled by a TOCCancelTokenSource.
