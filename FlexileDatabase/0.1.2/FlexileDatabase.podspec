           The Flexile Database is a set of classes to help manage information in a SQLite database (iPhone only at the moment) in an object oriented fasion. The header files are fully documented, so you can learn a lot about usage there.

The is one dependency: FlxToolkit. It a collection of classes, defines, functions, etc I use in most of my projects.

Warning: At the moment, while these classes handle just about all types of updates you can do on a SQLite database, they only handle single-table queries. I intend on adding joined queries in the near future... as soon as I can get to it.
