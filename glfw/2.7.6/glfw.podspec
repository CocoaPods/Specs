                    GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for opening a window,
                    creating an OpenGL context and managing input. It is easy to integrate into
                    existing applications and does not lay claim to the main loop.

                    GLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, Mac OS X and many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and FreeBSD.
