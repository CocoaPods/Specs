  "description": "NetworkingServiceKit is the reincarnation of the standard iOS monolith api client. Using a modular approach to services, the framework enables the user to select which services they will need to have running. Also, NetworkingServiceKit takes a different approach when it comes to using Network Clients like AFNetworking/Alamofire. All requests are routed through a protocol, which makes the library loosely coupled from the networking implementation.",
