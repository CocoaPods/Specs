Some converted from other languages.  \n* The utilities are broken down by type categories (I did what I thought was ok).\n* UtilityCues --> I mainly created these so as Swift morphs, I can easily adjust the function bodies and not all over the code base,\n                  plus, I may want to add later functionality.",
