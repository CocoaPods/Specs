  "description": " \n    PEGKit is a 'Parsing Expression Grammar' toolkit for iOS and OS X written by \n    Todd Ditchendorf in Objective-C and released under the MIT Open Source License.\n    PEGKit is heavily influenced by ANTLR by Terence Parr and \"Building Parsers with Java\" \n    by Steven John Metsker.\n\n    The PEGKit Framework offers 2 basic services of general interest to Cocoa developers:\n\n    * String Tokenization via the Objective-C PKTokenizer and PKToken classes.\n    \n    * Objective-C parser generation via grammars - Generate source code for an Objective-C parser class \n    from simple, intuitive, and powerful BNF-style grammars (similar to yacc or ANTLR). \n    While parsing, the generated parser will provide callbacks to your Objective-C delegate.\n  ",
