  "description": "  UIColor+ContrastColor\n  =====================\n\n  Returns either black or white based on the contrast against the current colour.\n\n  There are currently two options for determining which colour to use: the 50% method, or the YIQ method.\n\n  ## The 50% Method\n  #The self colour is converted to hex then checked if it is >= 0x808080. If the colour is >= 0x808080 then black colour is returned, otherwise white colour is returned.\n  #\n  ### The YIQ method\n  #The YIQ method is arguably better as it applies weighting to the colours, which could result in better contrast matches.\n  #\n  #![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squarefrog/UIColor-ContrastColor/master/screenshot.png)\n",
