  "description": "FeatureFlags makes it easy to configure feature flags, A/B and MVT tests via a JSON file which may be bundled with your app or hosted remotely. For remotely-hosted configuration files, you may enable / disable features without another release to the App Store, update the percentages of users in A/B test groups or even roll out a feature previously under A/B test to 100% of your users once you have decided that the feature is ready for prime time.",
