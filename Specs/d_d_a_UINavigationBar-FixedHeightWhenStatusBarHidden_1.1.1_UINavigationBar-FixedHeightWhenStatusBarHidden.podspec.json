  "description": "Normally on iOS 7+ navigation bar height equals to 64 px, when status bar is shown. After it is hidden, the height is changed to 44 px by default.\nThis category adds property `fixedHeightWhenStatusBarHidden` to UINavigationBar class. If set to YES navigation bar will keep its size even if status bar was hidden.\nThis is especially useful in case of \"drawer\"-styled side panel, when you want status bar to be hidden when this panel is shown.",
