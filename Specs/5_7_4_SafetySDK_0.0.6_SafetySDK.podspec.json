  "description": "We want to make public transport stress-free and safe for everyone. Our objective is to transfer a part of our Bluetooth nearby technology, to protect anyone during their offline commute! That’s why we’re looking to integrate our Safety SDK with third-party apps. Imagine if you didn’t need to download BuckleUp App, if it was just a toggle within Google Maps, City Mapper, Candy Crush… We’re also talking to major transport providers about how they can improve public transport with design-led thinking and smart data.",
