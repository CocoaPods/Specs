  "summary": "A radical & elegant animation library built for iOS.",
  "description": "Dance is a lightweight and straightforward animations framework built upon the new UIViewPropertyAnimator class introduced in iOS 10. With Dance, creating an animation for a view is as easy as calling view.dance.animate{ … } and can be started, paused, stopped, reversed, scrubbed through, and finished anywhere that the view can be referenced. Dance is especially forgiving, and provides the power that UIViewPropertyAnimator brings to iOS while at the same time maintaining ease of use.",
