  "description": "SVHTTPRequest is a simple and extremely straightforward way to communicate with RESTful web APIs for iOS and Mac. Itâ€™s a simpler and cleaner alternative to bulky ASIHTTPRequest, AFNetworking and RESTKit. It is blocked-based, uses NSURLConnection, ARC, as well as NSJSONSerialization to automatically parse JSON responses (making it only compatible with iOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion).",
