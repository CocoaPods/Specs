It is inspired by functional programming patterns, underscore.js, and the collection APIs from Scala. Common operations like \"map\", \"filter\", \"reduce\" are supported, and some unusual ones such as \"flatMap\". It uses lazy evaluation, avoiding the creation of lots of temporary collections and objects where possible.\n",
