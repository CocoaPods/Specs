  "description": "Google Cast Remote Display is a technology that allows content rendered on a sender device to be displayed on a large screen connected to a Google Cast device. This is particularly suitable to games who want to build a second screen experience for the living room, but also for applications with complex visuals that cannot be produced by a Google Cast device.
