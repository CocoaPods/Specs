  "description": "This framework provides a unified way of asking for user permissions on iOS. It also \n                    provides UI to explain the permission requirements before presenting the user with the \n                    system permission dialogue. This allows the developer to postpone the system dialogue. The framework \n                    provides no actual chrome, leaving the developer and designer in charge of creating the views.",
