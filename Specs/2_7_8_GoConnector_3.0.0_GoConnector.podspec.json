  "summary": "Provides an api for integrating with a Go device for taking card payments via Swipe, EMV dip, NFC Contactless",
  "description": "The Go Connector SDK currently supports the following payment transactions:\n*Sale* - A transaction used to authorize and capture the payment amount in at the same time. A Sale transaction is final and the amount cannot be adjusted. \n*Auth* - A transaction that can be tip-adjusted until it is finalized during a batch closeout. This is a standard model for a restaurant that adjusts the amount to include a tip after a card is charged.  \n*Void* - A transaction that cancels or fully reverses a payment transaction. \n*Refund* - A transaction that credits funds to the account holder.  \n*PreAuth* - A pre-authorization for a certain amount. \n*PreAuth Capture* - A Pre-Auth that has been finalized in order to complete a payment (i.e., a bar tab that has been closed out).   \n*Partial Auth* - A partial authorization. The payment gateway may return a partial authorization if the transaction amount exceeds the customer’s credit or debit card limit.  \n*Tip Adjust* - A transaction in which a merchant takes or edits a tip after the customer’s card has been processed (i.e., after the initial Auth transaction).",
