  "description": "A simplified Objective-C API for using NSNotifications and KVO with consistent terminology and useful convenience features.\nUses blocks exclusively, but unlike NSNotification's blocks API, allows removal using matching parameters instead of requiring storage of an observation object. Supports autoremoval when either observer or observee is deallocated.\nExtensible to other styles of observers, an included example is a wrapper for UIControl event actions.\nSwift and OS X support to come.",
