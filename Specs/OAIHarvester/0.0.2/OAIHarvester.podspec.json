  "description": "OAI-PMH Objective-C harvester is an Objective C library/wrapper over the OAI-PMH protocol. The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. Data Providers are repositories that expose structured metadata via OAI-PMH. Service Providers or metadata harvesters (like this one) then make OAI-PMH service requests to harvest that metadata. OAI-PMH is a set of six verbs or services that are invoked within HTTP.\n\n* Think: Why did you write this? What is the focus? What does it do?\n* CocoaPods will be using this to generate tags, and improve search results.\n* Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.\n* Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!",
