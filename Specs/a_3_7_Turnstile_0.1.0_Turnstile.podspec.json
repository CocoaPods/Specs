  "description": "Turnstile is a lightweight implementation of a [Finite State Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) in Swift.\n\nTurnstile is inspired by some of the existing open source implementations of State Machines in Swift, in particular:\n* [Transporter](https://github.com/DenHeadless/Transporter)\n* [SwiftyStateMachine](https://github.com/macoscope/SwiftyStateMachine)\n\nTurnstile aims to be simple to use, while maintaning a clean API.\n\nTurnstile builds as a framework, and therefore needs iOS 8.\n",
