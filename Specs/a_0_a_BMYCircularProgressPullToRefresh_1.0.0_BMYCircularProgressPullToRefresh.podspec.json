  "summary": "Pull to fresh with circular progress view as used in the Beamly iOS app.",
  "description": "This version of the pull to refresh feature can be used both on UITableViews and UICollectionViews. When dealing with a custom pull to refresh view, often the native UIRefreshControl is not ideal as it is not customizable. A common customization besides the pull to refresh, is to have a circular progress view with the logo of the app to show during the dragging.",
