Some\n                   websites like Facebook may use slightly differring OAuth2 implementations, for those the\n                   framework aims to provide specific subclasses handling these differences.\n                   \n                   Start with `import p2_OAuth2` in your source files. Code documentation is available from within\n                   Xcode (ALT + click on symbols) and on [p2.github.io/OAuth2/](http://p2.github.io/OAuth2/).\n",
