  "description": "Outlets provides a set of functions to make validating that `IBOutlets` are\nconnected between your Storyboard/XIB file and view controller properties. It\ncan also validate that `IBAction` methods are connected correctly as well.\n\nFor an explanation of the approach and how these assertions work see\n[Testing IBOutlets and IBActions With Curried Functions in Swift](http://phatbl.at/2016/04/29/testing-iboutlets-and-ibactions-with-curried-functions-in-swift.html)\n\nThe standalone\n[OutletActionAssertion](https://github.com/phatblat/OutletActionAssertion)\nproject demonstrates how they work.",
