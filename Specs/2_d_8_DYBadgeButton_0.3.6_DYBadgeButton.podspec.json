If the string value of the badge changes from nil (or \"nullish\") to a valid string value  at runtime the badge will appear with a pop up effect. If it switches back to a \"nullish\" value, it will shrink and disappear.\nThe class also includes a class function to create a button with an image and a title, which is positioned underneath the image.",
