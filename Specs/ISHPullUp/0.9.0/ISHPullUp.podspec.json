The layout can be managed entirely via delegation and is easy to use with autolayout.\n\nTwo view subclasses are provided to make beautiful iOS10 style designs easier. ISHPullUpHandleView provides a drag handle as seen in the notification center or Maps app with three states: up, neutral, down. ISHPullUpRoundedView provides the perfect backing view for your bottom view controller with a hairline border and rounded top corners.",
