  "description": "                   Provides an easy way to define *environment* settings in a\n                   **Environment.plist** file. For example you might define a\n                   *baseURL* as `http://my.awesome.service` for some web service your\n                   app communicates with. During development you might want to have\n                   the app use a *test* server, however, so **BREnvironment** \n                   supports a **LocalEnvironment.plist** file where you can override\n                   that *baseURL* setting to `http://my.crashful.service`.\n",

An example script is:\n\n                    filePath=${SRCROOT}/PathToYourOwn/LocalEnvironment.plist\n                    if [ -e \"$filePath\" ]; then\n                        cp \"$filePath\" \"${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH}/\"\n                        echo $filePath copied to ${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH}\n                    else\n                        echo $filePath not found.\n                    fi\n\n                    Just change the filePath to match the path to the file you want to use.\n                    EOF\n"
