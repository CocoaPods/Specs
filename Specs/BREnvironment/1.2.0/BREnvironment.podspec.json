  "description": "Provides an easy way to define *environment* settings in a\n**Environment.plist** file. For example you might define a\n*baseURL* as `http://my.awesome.service` for some web service your\napp communicates with. During development you might want to have\nthe app use a *test* server, however, so **BREnvironment** \nsupports a **LocalEnvironment.plist** file where you can override\nthat *baseURL* setting to `http://my.crashful.service`.",
