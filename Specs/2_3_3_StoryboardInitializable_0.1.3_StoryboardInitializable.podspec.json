  "description": "A great advantage of using a storyboard with multiple views in it is that you can get a wholistic view of the app along with the navigation flow, but this has a major downside if you work with a team. \n\n- Source Control - endless merge conflicts on the storyboard, if each screen was kept seperate the number of conflicts would reduce. \n- Navigation - if the storyboard has multiple screens with navigation within the storyboard can become difficult or you might end up changing something unintentionally.\n-  Storyboard Id - using storyboard ids can be error prone or lead to boilerplate code\n\nSolution - Use a single storyboard per screen :)",
