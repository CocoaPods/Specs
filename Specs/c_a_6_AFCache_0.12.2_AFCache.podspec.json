  "description": "\tAFCache is an HTTP disk cache for use on iPhone/iPad and OSX. It can be linked as a static library or as a framework. \n\tThe cache was initially written because on iOS, NSURLCache ignores NSURLCacheStorageAllowed and instead treats it as \n\tNSURLCacheStorageAllowedInMemoryOnly which is pretty useless for a persistent cache.\n",
