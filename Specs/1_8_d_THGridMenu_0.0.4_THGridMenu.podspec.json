  "description": "\t\t\tTHGridMenu is a UIView that is initialized with number of columns per row, gutter size, margin and row height. You can call an instance method `createMenuItem` that will return a THGridMenuItem at the right origin and width for the next view. THGridMenuItem is a subclass of UIControl, which itself is a subclass of UIView, so you can put anything you'd like inside.\n\n\t\t\t*Note: Currently, THMenuGrid is meant to be contained inside of a navigation controller. You might have to modify to use in a standalone view or a tab controller.*\n",
