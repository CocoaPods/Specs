  "description": "The SDK listens for \"trigger\" signals from various analog and digital technologies.  These may include: Audio trigguers, BluetoothLE triggers, UURLs (deep links), \"Touch\" buttons, etc.  All these technologies are used by commercial intererest to transmit offers and promotions to an app on a mobile device.\nOnce the SDK senses a valid signal, it then forwards that information to the actv8me servers which will return to the app an offer or promotion, etc.",
