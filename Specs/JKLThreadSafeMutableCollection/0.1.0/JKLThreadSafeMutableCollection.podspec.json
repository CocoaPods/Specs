JKLThreadSafeMutableCollection is developed to replace all those mutable classes by a lightweight solution.\nThis collection inlcudes **JKLThreadSafeMutableDictionary**, **JKLThreadSafeMutableArray** and **JKLThreadSafeMutableSet**.  All these classses support most of original NSMutable methods, include subscript feature(Ex. dictionary[key], array[index]).",
