  "description": "AutomaticRefreshControl seeks to behave the way I personally expected UIRefreshControl to work when I first discovered it. 1) AutomaticRefreshControl reveals itself on beginRefreshing() which allows you to trigger it programmatically. 2) AutomaticRefreshControl fixes an issue where a UIRefreshControl's tintColor is not applied the first time the control is displayed; which makes it completely invisible on iOS 10. While the solution here is pretty hacky, it works!",
