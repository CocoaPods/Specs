  "description": "LogViewer is a simple log viewer in iOS applications. You can see the debugging log on the app screen as if in Xcode log console. It's good for testing in the remote area without mac or a beginner who don't know the procedure the method calls yet. The view size is easily changeable. So this doesn't bother the screen touch event.\n\nAdding this module is really easy. Just only 3 steps, you can use LogViewer. When you don't want to show the log on the screen, only you have to do is to disable the feature.\n\nDownload and try to do it!",
