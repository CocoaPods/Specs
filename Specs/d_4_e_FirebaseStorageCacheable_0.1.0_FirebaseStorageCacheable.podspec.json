  "description": "This library allows you download and cache files hosted in Firebase storage.\n  \nAll you need to do is provide the file name to store the file as locally, along with the remote file name, and the library will handle the rest.\n\nIt uses timestamps of your local file, compared to the timestamp of the remote file (without downloading the remote file to check), to determine if the remote file is newer.\n\nThe replaceIfAvailable, replaces the local file with a copy of the remote one. The API includes onComplete and onError closures as parameters to keep your code loosely coupled.\n\nWhen replacing a file, you may also provide an onProgress closure to can inform your app of download progress.\n\nIt also supports replacing a bundled file, as well.\n\nThis does require that you use FirebaseStorage.",
