  "description": "EarlGrey is an iOS UI test automation framework. It is built on XCTest and integrates directly into Xcode's Test Navigator panel. EarlGrey allows tests to interact with the app similarly to how an end-user would. It synchronizes automatically with various UI altering events so test operations see the UI in a stable state each time they are executed.",
