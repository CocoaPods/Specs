  "description": "                   **libCollections** is an Objective-C library that brings\n                   methods from Smalltalk's collection protocol and Ruby's\n                   Enumerable mixin to Objective-C. It adds these methods\n                   as categories to the Foundation framework's collections\n                   and string classes.\n\n                   In a nutshell, libCollections seeks to add some a\n                   functional programming flair to the standard collections\n                   and string classes on OS X and iOS.\n",
