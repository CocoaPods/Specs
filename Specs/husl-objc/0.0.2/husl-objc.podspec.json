  "description": "  CIELUV is a color space designed for perceptual uniformity based on human experiments. When accessed by polar coordinates, it becomes functionally similar to HSL with a single problem: its chroma component doesn't fit into a specific range.\n\n  HUSL extends CIELUV with a new saturation component that allows you to span all the available chroma as a neat percentage.\n",
