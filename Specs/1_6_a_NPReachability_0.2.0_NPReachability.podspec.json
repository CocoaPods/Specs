  "description": "Apple's Reachability example broadcasts changes in network connectivity through\nnotifications.  NPReachability also does this but also provides the options of\nusing KVO to monitor changes, or even to provide a block to be executed when\nchanges happen.\n\nMonitoring is simpler; you're either connected or not. Testing for the\nreachability of a particular URL is best done by actually trying to connect and\ndealing with the errors.\n\nApple's Reachability sample has been rewritten to use NPReachability, see the\nreadme for details.\n",
