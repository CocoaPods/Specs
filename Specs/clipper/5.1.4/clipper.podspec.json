  "description": "The Clipper library primarily performs the boolean clipping operations - intersection, union, difference & xor - on 2D polygons. It also performs polygon offsetting.\nThe library handles complex (self-intersecting) polygons, polygons with holes and polygons with overlapping co-linear edges.\nInput polygons for clipping can use EvenOdd, NonZero, Positive and Negative filling modes.\nThe clipping code is based on the Vatti clipping algorithm, and out performs other clipping libraries.\n",
