  "description": "Task is a simple Cocoa framework for expressing and executing your application’s\nworkflows. Using Task, you need only express each step in your workflow — called\ntasks — and what their prerequisite tasks are. After that, the framework handles\nthe mechanics of executing the steps in the correct order with the appropriate\nlevel of concurrency, letting you know when tasks finish or fail. It also makes\nit easy to cancel tasks, retry failed tasks, and re-run previously completed\ntasks and workflows.",
