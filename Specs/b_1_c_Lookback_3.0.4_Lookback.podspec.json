  "description": "Lookback is a tool and library for user experience research\nthat you can integrate into your app. Lookback records the\niOS screen, the front-facing camera, microphone, metadata,\ntouches and active views, and uploads it all in\nnear-realtime to lookback.io where you can study and dive\ninto the data. Example use cases:\n\n* Remote research. Invite testers to test your app with just a\n  Participate link, and no additional setp.\n* User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your\n  testing lab to record both the screen and your tester's\n  reactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.\n* Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of\n  using your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring\n  problems.\n\nHead over to [the SDK guide on our website](http://help.lookback.io/installing-the-ios-sdk/configuring-lookback/configuring-lookback-participate) to get started!\n\nNOTE: There used to be separate \"Lookback\" and \"LookbackSafe\" pods. This pod replaces both, and is\nAppStore safe. Lookback HD is no more.",
