  "summary": "A lightweight yet powerful state-based router written in Swift.",
  "description": "Monarch Router is a declarative routing handler that decouples ViewControllers from each other. It follows a Coordinator and Presenter pattern, also referred to as Flow Controllers.\n\nMonarch Router makes an excellent MVVM companion and fits right in with Redux style State Flow and Reactive frameworks.\n\nThe Coordinator is constructed by declaring a route hierarchy mapped with a URL structure.\n\nMonarch Router is inspired by Featherweight Router. Currently, it works only with iOS/iPhone.",
