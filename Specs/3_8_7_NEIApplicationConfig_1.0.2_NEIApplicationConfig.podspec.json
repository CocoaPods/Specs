  "description": "NEIApplicationConfig allows developers to have configurations defined in a config file per environment & bundle identifier,\nwhich makes deployment and testing multiple versions easier. While usage of application properties via .plist is useful,\nNEIApplicationConfig allows you can easily target Simulator, Device and Production \nenvironments respectively, in addition to overrides specific to a bundle identifier, e.g. Production, Beta, Adhoc, etc. \nWith NEIApplicationConfig, you will specify a default configuration as a baseline, and overrides that are \npertinent to their respective circumstances.",
