  "description": "iOS 13 introduced an awesome way to provide stocks-charts to visually impaired users.\nUnfortunately there is no public API from Apple that enables developers to implement it in other apps (yet).\n\nI think that charts can provide a great way of presenting information, but we should not limit their use to those without impairments.\nThis is where Audiograph comes into play.",
