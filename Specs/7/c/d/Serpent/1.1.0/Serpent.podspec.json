  "homepage": "https://github.com/nodes-ios/Serpent",
  "description": "Serpent is a framework made for creating model objects or structs that can be easily serialized and deserialized from/to JSON. It's easily expandable and handles all common data types used when consuming a REST API, as well as recursive parsing of custom objects.\nIt's designed to be used together with our helper app, the Model Boiler, making model creation a breeze. Serpent is implemented using protocol extensions and static typing.\nAlso provides extensions for Alamofire and Cashier.",
