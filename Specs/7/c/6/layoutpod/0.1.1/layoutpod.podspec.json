  "description": "NSLayoutAnchors can get wordy, for example, four lines are required to constrain a subview to all four sides of the superview. This library allows you to do the same constraint with a single line. When developing views programatically, this library will greatly reduce the amount of code, and vastly improve the DRYness of the code.",
