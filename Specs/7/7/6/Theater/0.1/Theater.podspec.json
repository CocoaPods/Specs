  "description": "Writing async, resilient and responsive applications is too hard. \n\nIn the case of iOS, is because we've been using the wrong abstraction level: NSOperationQueues, dispatch_semaphore_create, dispatch_semaphore_wait and other low level GCD functions and structures.\n\nUsing the Actor Model, we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications.\n\nTheater is Open Source and available under the Apache 2 License.\n\nTheater is inspired by Akka.",
