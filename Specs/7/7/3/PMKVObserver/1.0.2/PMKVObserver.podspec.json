  "summary": "Modern thread-safe and type-safe key-value observing for Swift and Objective-C.",
  "description": "PMKVObserver provides a safe block-based wrapper around Key-Value Observing, with APIs for both Obj-C and Swift. Features include:\n\n* Thread-safety. Observers can be registered on a different thread than KVO notifications are sent on, and can be cancelled on yet another thread. An observer can even be cancelled from two thread simultaneously.\n* Automatic unregistering when the observed object deallocates.\n* Support for providing an observing object that is given to the block, and automatic unregistering when this observing object deallocates. This lets you call methods on `self` without retaining it or dealing with a weak reference.\n* Thread-safety for the automatic deallocation. This protects against receiving messages on another thread while the object is deallocating.\n* First-class support for both Obj-C and Swift, including strong typing in the Swift API.",
