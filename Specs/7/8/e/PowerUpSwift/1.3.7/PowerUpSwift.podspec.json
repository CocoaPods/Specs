  "description": "Apple doesn't provide some basic useful utilities to make our iOS Development lives a little easier. This might be for a [good] reason, such as keeping the platform lightweight. It sometimes requires extra time and effort to implement a simple basic feature that you can easily do in Android built-in, so you end up doing a couple more hacks. This library was created to save time, to be more productive, and to be DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).",
