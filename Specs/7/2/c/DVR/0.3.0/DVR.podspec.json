  "description": "DVR is a simple Swift framework for making fake NSURLSession requests for iOS, watchOS, and OS X based on VCR.\n\nEasy dependency injection is the main design goal. The API is the same as NSURLSession.\n\nDVR.Session is a subclass of NSURLSession so you can use it as a drop in replacement anywhere. (Currently only data tasks are supported.)",
