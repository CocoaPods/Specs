  "summary": "A tiny Promises library.",
  "description": "PinkyPromise is a lightweight tool for coordinating asynchronous code.\n\nIt consists of a Promise type, which represents a task,\nand a Result type, which represents success or failure.\nThese are immutable values that can be transformed in functional style.\n\nResult encodes the return-or-throw pattern common in synchronous code\nsuch that asynchronous completion blocks can use that pattern,\nwith a much tighter contract than (AnyObject?, ErrorType?) -> Void.\n\nPromise separates the events of creating an asynchronous operation with\narguments, and starting it with a completion block. Since it is a value,\nyou can add more steps by making composite Promises.\n\nPinkyPromise is worth using if you don't want a complex framework\nor if you're just getting started with functional patterns.\nA suitable step up from PinkyPromise is RxSwift's Observables.",
