  "description": "Based on the network abstraction of secondary encapsulation of Moya. Maintain the same usage method of Moya and extend Moya’s TargetType implements commonly used data parsing, supporting: HandyJSON,ObjectMapper, Codable, SwiftyJSON, Developer there is no need to write boilerplate code for data parsing. You only need to care about what kind of data you want and select the data type. SYMoyaNetwork has done all this. SYMoyaNetwork also implements network caching, and configure common caching strategies to only implement the desired caching strategy. Response will perform cache synchronization according to the policy. Developers no longer need to spend a lot of time doing such work. SYMoyaNetwork allows data requests Become simple, less developers write boilerplate code, more time to focus on business.",
