  "description": "IRCrypto aims to provide the following:\n\nCryptographic Key Derivation (using PBKDF2 with 10,000 rounds) from a String\nSymmetric AES Key generation (128, 256, 512 bits)\nAsymmetric RSA Key generation (1024, 2048 and 4096 bits)\nAsymmetric EC Key generation (256, 384 and 521 bits) (Read More)\nData hashing (using SHA256)\nData signing (using HMAC - SHA256 + 256 bit key)\nSymmetric Encryption (AES in CBC mode)\nAsymmetric Encryption (RSA)\nAuthenticated Encryption using the Encrypt-then-MAC scheme (AES in CBC mode and HMAC) [RNCryptor Data Format v3]\nPublic Key Encryption with Authenticated Encryption (RSA + AES in CBC mode and HMAC) [RNCryptor Data Format v3]\nYou can also:\n\nSave the generated keys (AES, RSA, EC) in the Keychain and protect them with TouchID and/or a user generated password\nGenerate an asymmetric key pair (RSA) for signing data, where the private key will never be returned and just used for singning directly from the Secure Enclave",
