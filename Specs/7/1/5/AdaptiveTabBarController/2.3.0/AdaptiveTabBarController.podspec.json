It provides a floating action button which\ncan have actions presented when tapped. It uses the built in UITabBarController while in\na compact trait environment, and a custom built vertical tab bar controller while in a\nregular trait environment. The controller automatically adapts between the two as the\ntrait environemtn changes (e.g. split screen adjustments on iPad)",
