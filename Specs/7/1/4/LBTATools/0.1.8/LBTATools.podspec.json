  "summary": "Set of tools to drastically improve development speed of UI in iOS applications",
  "description": "A lot of the applications built for contract and consulting gigs require a ton of heavy lifting in terms of boilerplate code.  For the most part, I do a lot of prototyping and enjoy using a large set of tools that help me avoid a ton of repetitive syntax.  This library is aimed to reduce all the mundane code related to UI development.",
