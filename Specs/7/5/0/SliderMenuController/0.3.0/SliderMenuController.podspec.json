  "description": "This framework provides an extendable UIViewController with built-in support for stretching and contracting a view at the bottom a screen. The developer can set different 'stickyPoints' where the SliderMenu will snap to when the user stops dragging the 'handleBar'. The SliderMenu can be adjusted to only expand enough to fit it's contents, and is well-suited for displaying important information while keeping the previous ViewController's view visible and interactable in the background. I was originally using the 'PullUpController' pod made by Mario Iannotta => info@marioiannotta.com, but after expanding his class to properly support landscape orientation, I also refactored how the class handled 'stickyPoints' and decided to set up the SliderMenuController as its own pod.",
