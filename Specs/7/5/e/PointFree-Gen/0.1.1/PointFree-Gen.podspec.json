  "description": "Swift's randomness API is powerful and simple to use. It allows us to create\nrandom values from many basic types, such as booleans and numeric types, and\nit allows us to randomly shuffle arrays and pluck random elements from\ncollections.\n\nHowever, it does not make it easy for us to extend the randomness API, nor\ndoes it provide an API that is composable, which would allow us to create\ncomplex types of randomness from simpler pieces.\n\nGen is a lightweight wrapper over Swift's randomness APIs that makes it easy\nto build custom generators of any kind of value.",
