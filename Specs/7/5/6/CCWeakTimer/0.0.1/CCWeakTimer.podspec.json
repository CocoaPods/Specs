  "description": "More often than not, an object needs to create a timer and invalidate it when a certain event occurs. However, doing this when that object works with a private GCD queue gets tricky. This timer object is thread safe and doesn't have the notion of run loop, so it can be used with GCD queues and installed / invalidated from any thread or queue.",
