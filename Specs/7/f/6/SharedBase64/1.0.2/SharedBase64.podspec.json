  "description": "    Optimized for fast string encoded binary cross-platform communication. Offers base64 encoding based on C code with several wrappers. Base 64 encoded strings will have no wrapping, no padding and are url safe. Only dependency is to <stdlib.h> to acces memory, so usable on many platforms. There is already an objective-c wrapper to use with OSX/iOS.\n",
