  "description": "\t\t\t\t   Here I present a very simple framework to handle connections in a very efficient and easy way. Just give a NSURLRequest and you will have in return the result of a NSURLConnection.\n\n\t\t\t\t   The connections are performed asynchronously and the framework allows you to:\n\n\t\t\t\t   * Cancel requests\n\t\t\t\t   * Set priorities\n\t\t\t\t   * Manage multiple connection queues\n\t\t\t\t   * Configure connection queues individualy\n\t\t\t\t   * Pause and restart connections\n\t\t\t\t   * Get feedback of downloading/uploading status\n\t\t\t\t   * Define credentials and trusted servers\n\t\t\t\t   * Get the return of the connection using blocks\n",
