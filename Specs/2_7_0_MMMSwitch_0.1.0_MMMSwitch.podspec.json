  "description": "                   **A `UISwitch` Alternative that Supports Auto Layout, Resizing, and Visual Customization with Rich State Callback.**\n\n`MMMSwitch` is a `UISwitch` alternative* that fully supports Auto Layout (meaning it responds appropriately to constraint-based layout changes), supports being arbitrarily sized and resized, supports visual customization, and has a rich callback method for state changes.\n\n*Not a `UISwitch` replacement -- it has good functional equivalency, but isn't guaranteed to be drop-in compatible with code that was using a `UISwitch` before.\n\n## Why Use It?\n\nThere are lots of great `UISwitch` replacements out there, so why create another one? Well, unlike the others out there, `MMMSwitch`:\n\n* Works great in Auto Layout environments\n  * It won't get distorted when it gets resized due to changing constraints or when it gets its size animated\n* Has a *rich state callback method* \n  * It can distinguish between all user-distinguishable states, so it can tell you whether it's completely off, or if, for instance, the user's pressing it down but has yet switched its state yet. \n  * Too much info for you? No problem -- just use the callback but check `MMMSwitch`'s `isOn` parameter inside of the callback and get the basic on/off info you want.\n",
