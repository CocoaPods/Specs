  "summary": "KeyPathKit leverages Swift 4 KeyPath type in order to implement a SQL-like data manipulation API",
  "description": "Swift 4 has introduced a new type called KeyPath, with allows to access the properties of an object with a very nice syntax. For instance:\n\nlet string = \"Foo\"\nlet keyPathForCount = String.count\n\nlet count = string[keyPath: keyPathForCount] // count == 3\nThe great part is that the syntax can be very concise, because it supports type inference and property chaining.\n\nConsequently, I thought it would be nice to leverage this new concept in order to build an API that allows to perform data manipulation in a very declarative fashion.\n\nSQL is a great language for such manipulations, so I took inspiration from it and implemented most of its standard operators in Swift 4 using KeyPath.\n\nBut what really stands KeyPathKit appart from the competition is its clever syntax that allows to express queries in a very seamless fashion. For instance :\n\ncontacts.filter(where: .lastName == \"Webb\" && .age < 40)",
