  "description": "                    RNBlurModal adds depth to the traditional modal/alert view. Calling the view is incredibly similar to setting up and showing a UIAlertView. You can also setup your own custom views and display them with a blurry background. The goal is to truly draw the user's focus directly to your alert using natural effects. This project works on all iOS devices at all orientations with ARC.\n",
