  "description": "Twitter created a framework for logging in order to fulfill the following requirements:\n    - fast (no blocking the main thread)\n    - thread safe\n    - as easy as NSLog in most situations\n    - support pluggable \"outputs streams\" to which messages will be delivered\n    - \"outputs streams\" filter messages rather than global filtering for all \"output streams\"\n    - able to categorize log messages (log channels)\n    - able to designate importance to log messages (log levels)\n    - force opt-in for persisted logs (a security requirement, fulfilled by using the context feature of TLS)",
