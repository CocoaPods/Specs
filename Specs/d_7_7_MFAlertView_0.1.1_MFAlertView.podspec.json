It allows for a few customization options, but it's main purpose is to provide a quick way to present a dialog with an arbitrary number of actions. The alert view provides a very quick and easy way to present a range of buttons with text, images, or custom views.\n2. Activity Indicator - The activity indicator can be presented and dismissed on command, or it can be used as a progress indicator.\n2. Status Updates - Status updates are labels that will appear on top of the main view for a brief period to indicate some change in state.",
