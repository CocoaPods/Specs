  "description": "                    GTM HTTP Fetcher makes it easy for Cocoa applications to perform http\n                    operations. The fetcher is implemented as a wrapper on NSURLConnection,\n                    so its behavior is asynchronous and uses operating-system settings on\n                    iOS and Mac OS X.\n",
