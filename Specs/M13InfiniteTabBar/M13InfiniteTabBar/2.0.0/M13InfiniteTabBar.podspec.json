  "description": "                   M13InfiniteTabBar was created to get rid of the \"More\" button on the UITabBar. Why should have to preform an extra two taps to get to the tab I want. M13InfiniteTabBar puts all the tabs on one level, in an intuitive, stylized manner. I've been using this in my app, \"What's My Stage On?\" since August 2012, and have decided to clean it up, and turn it into an easy to use subclass for everyone.\n",
