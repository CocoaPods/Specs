  "summary": "Simple yet useful helper class for managing selection of objects, typically used in table views.",
  "description": "This class is no more than just a wrapper around a Set containing objects of a specific kind. Its main goal is to unify the way in which code is written when selection patterns appear, preveting developers from having to write boilerplate and error-prone code once and again for performing such a simple task.",
