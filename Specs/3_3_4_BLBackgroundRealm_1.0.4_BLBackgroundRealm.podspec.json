  "description": "BLBackgroundRealm is a collection of handy classes and extensions that make it easier to work with `Realm` in the background.\n\nIt's main focus is to enhance existing `Realm`s and Realm-based code bases with very little overhead and refactoring.\n\n**Note**: Although this module makes it more convenient to work with a `Realm` in the background, it does **not** make  `Realm`s nor its objects thread-safe. They should still be accessed only from within their appropriate thread.\n\nFor the Swift counterpart, see [BackgroundRealm](https://github.com/BellAppLab/BackgroundRealm).",
