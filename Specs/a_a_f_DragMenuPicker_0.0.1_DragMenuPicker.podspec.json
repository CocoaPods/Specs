  "description": "DragMenuPicker\n===\n\nA custom picker lets you pick an option from its auto scrolling menu without lifting your finger up.\n\nYou can either use the `@IBDesignable` picker button `DragMenuPicker` or create your own with `DragMenuView` which implements all picker logic.\n\nDemo\n----\n![alt tag](https://github.com/cemolcay/DragMenuPicker/raw/master/Demo.gif)\n\nRequirements\n----\n\n- iOS 9.0+\n- Swift 3.0+\n\nInstall\n----\n\n```\npod 'DragMenuPicker'\n```\n\nUsage\n----\n\nCreate a `DragMenuPicker` from either storyboard or programmatically.\nSet its `title` and `items` property to shown in menu.\nSet its `didSelectItem` property or implement `dragMenuView(_ dragMenuView: DragMenuView, didSelect item: String, at index: Int)` delegate method to set your action after picking.\nYou can also set its `direction`, either horizontal or vertical with `margins` to screen edges.\n\n\n``` swift\nhorizontalDragPicker?.title = \"Horizontal Picker\"\nhorizontalDragPicker?.items = [\"First\", \"Second\", \"Third\", \"Fourth\", \"Other\", \"Another\", \"Item 2\", \"Item 3\"]\nhorizontalDragPicker?.direction = .horizontal\nhorizontalDragPicker?.margins = 20\nhorizontalDragPicker?.menuDelegate = self\nhorizontalDragPicker?.didSelectItem = { item, index in\nprint(\"(item) selected at index (index)\")\n}\n```\n\n\n`DragMenuPicker` shows `DragMenuView` with `DragMenuItemView`s inside when you touch down the picker. It disappears after you pick something from menu or cancel picking by lifting your finger up outside of the menu.\n\nThey are heavily customisable. You can set `applyStyle` property which callbacks you prototype menu and item that you can style and it applies it to menu.\n\nAlso there are `@IBInspectable` properties on `DragMenuPicker` that you can style basic properties inside storyboard.",
