  "description": "\t\t\t\t\tChecksums are a useful way to quickly check the contents of\n\t\t\t\t\ta bunch of data. The MD5 checksum spits out 16 bytes of\n\t\t\t\t\trandom numbers. While this is great for computers, humans\n\t\t\t\t\tdon't want to look at a huge hex string. The emoji checksum\n\t\t\t\t\tcalculator spits out 4 emoji character hash.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe caclulator uses 845 different emoji characters for a\n\t\t\t\t\ttotal of 509,831,700,625 unique hash codes. Good enough.\n",
