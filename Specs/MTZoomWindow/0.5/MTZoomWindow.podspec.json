  "description": "This class provides a simple way to zoom a specific UIView and display it fullscreen, upon a defined action of the user (uses UIGestureRecognizer to detect actions). If the user performs the action on the specified UIView the view gets zoomed in animated and is displayed fullscreen, with a black background. If the user performs the same gesture again, the UIView gets zoomed back out and everything is like it was before.",
