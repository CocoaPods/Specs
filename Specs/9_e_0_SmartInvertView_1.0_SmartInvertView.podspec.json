  "description": "Like me you are a lazy developer and you hate when you enable Smart Invert accessibility feature on your iDevice but the app you use doesn't support it, so images are not visible/readable ? Look at where point my finger ðŸ‘‰ Instagram, Messenger, Snapchat ...\n\nSmartInvert pod is just a simple extension of `UIView` with a property `smartinvert` which enable the support of Smart Invert of the view, and also add this accessibility feature in all your `UIView` in your Storyboard thanks to the `IBInspectable` feature. \n\nMore over you can use two class `SmartInvertView` and `SmartInvertImageView` which enable this feature automically.",
