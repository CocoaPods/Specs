  "description": "                   The Ultimate Parental Gate is designed to help block children from accessing in app purchases within an app. Most \"Parental Gates\" simply ask a math question or provide a question that a child can figure out by randomly selecting an item on the screen. This is unique in it requires both math and dexterity skills to succeed, which typically a child does not have at a young age. This is the same Parental Gate used in the popular special needs app, SpeechBox for iPad. Therefore, this has been tested for over a year in both home and clinical environments, and have yet had a child get past the gate. This doesn't mean it's perfect, but it provides more security than other solutions.\n",
