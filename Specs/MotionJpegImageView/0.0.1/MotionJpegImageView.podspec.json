  "description": "                      MotionJpegImageView creates a connection to the stream\n                      and receives JPEG frames one at a time over the network.\n                      It turns out this approach is typically seven or eight\n                      times faster than using UIWebView to render MJPEG\n                      streams.\n\n                      Just provide a URL for the video stream and you're good.\n                      Internally, MotionJpegImageView achieves better\n                      performance by avoiding overheads of parsing and\n                      rendering each frame as if it were a web page which\n                      UIView does.\n\n                      Internally, MotionJpegImageView creates a connection to\n                      the stream and receives frames one at a time over the\n                      network. As it receives each frame, it hydrates the\n                      stream data into a UIImage object, and then sets its\n                      inherited image property. Thus the only bottlenecks\n                      to getting high framerates are:\n\n                      1. The speed of your network connection\n                      2. The frame rate of the IP camera\n                      3. The phoneâ€™s ability to process inbound packets and\n                      rehydrate UIImage files from raw JPEG data.\n",
