  "summary": "A class that leverages blocks to allow for better organization of code in some cases.",
  "description": "This pod defines a class \"cblock\" with just two class methods--[cblock make:] and [cblock run:].  The make: method allows the programmer to use a block to define a custom object, keeping all of the intialization code together and making the code overall easier to read.  The run: method simply allows the programmer to run a block as soon as it is defined, but offers an inline solution to do so.",
