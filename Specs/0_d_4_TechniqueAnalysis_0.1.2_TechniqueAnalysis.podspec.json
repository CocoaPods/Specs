  "description": "This is a CocoaPod which processes video footage of a user doing an exercise and provides feedback on the user's form. The general idea is to capture a timeseries, where each data point contains an array of body point locations in 2D space, along with a confidence level on the accuracy of each body point. Timeseries are compared using k-Nearest Neighbor and Dynamic Time Warping to find the nearest neighbor.",
