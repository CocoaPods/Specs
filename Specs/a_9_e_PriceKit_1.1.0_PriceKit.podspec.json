  "description": "Get App Store prices by tier and locale.\nUse PriceKit if you have a temporarily discounted SKProduct and you want to\nto display the regular price next to the discount price (strikethrough pricing).\nUse PriceKit to get the product's regular price given the product's tier and price locale.\nPricing information is generated from Apple's product pricing matrix CSV available from iTunes Connect.\nNOTE: By default, pricing information is baked into the pod and is not dynamically fetched from iTunes Connect or any other web service.\nAs such, PriceKit's pricing data may become out of date at any time and there are no guarantees of the accuracy of the data. Use at your own risk.\nKeep your pod regularly updated, or host the pricing matrix CSV on your own web service and regularly update it from iTunes Connect, passing it into PriceKit for parsing.",
