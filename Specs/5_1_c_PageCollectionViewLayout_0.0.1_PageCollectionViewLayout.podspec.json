  "description": "I did not like how the UIPageViewController handled data. I didn't really need a new viewcontroller for each screen so I developed a UICollectionViewLay (subclass of UICollectionFlowLayout) that would mimic the look but would allow me to preform data updates similar to that of the UITableViewContoller.",
