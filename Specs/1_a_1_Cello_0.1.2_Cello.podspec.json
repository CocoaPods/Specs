  "description": "Cello is a library that brings higher level programming to C.\n\nBy acting as a modern, powerful runtime system Cello makes many things easy that were previously impractical or awkward in C such as:\n\n    Generic Data Structures\n    Polymorphic Functions\n    Interfaces / Type Classes\n    Constructors / Destructors\n    Optional Garbage Collection\n    Exceptions\n    Reflection\n\nAnd because Cello works seamlessly alongside standard C you get all the other benefits such as great performance, powerful tooling, and extensive libraries.",
