  "description": "There are more elaborate frameworks for accessing the Instagram API out there. But none of them worked for me, and lots of code was required to make them work. This is the Pod I would have liked to use. It authenticates with instagram reliably, all you have to do is show the included view controller and you get back an authentication token. As simple as possible, but not simpler. Yeah I wrote this on the beach.",
