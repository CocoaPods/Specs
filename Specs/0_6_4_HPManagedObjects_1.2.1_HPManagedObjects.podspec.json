  "description": "Hi there! Some time ago (maybe 3 years) I wrote this library for our company for make our life little easier with serialize/deserialize server response/request to/from JSON with obj-c models. we improving it all that time. and now I glad share it with obj-c community. https://github.com/DimasSup/HPManagedObjects About it - easy mapping swift/obj-c class, like EasyMapping, but more faster. In synthetic tests: on simulator 1150000 objects (with inheritance, objects in objects) EasyMapping: Serialize 3.5 seconds HPManagedObjects: Serialize 2.5 seconds EasyMapping: Deserialize 6.6 seconds HPManagedObjects: Deserialize 2.7 seconds Why we have more performance? We used cache for mapping models, also we caching some runtime info for property types. I will be happy hear your thinks about this lib and suggestion if you have one",
