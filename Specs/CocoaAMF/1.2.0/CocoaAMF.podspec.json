  "description": "                       CocoaAMF is a set of classes which can make fast AMF0 and AMF3 remote-ing calls or act as a server to handle AMF requests. The communication in AMF format is almost 10x faster than same data structure in XML and JSON (http://census2.jamesward.com/). You can still use your existing web services by adding simple AMF bridge.\n                       \n                       Action Message Format (AMF) is a binary format used to serialize object graphs such as ActionScript objects and XML, or send messages between an Adobe Flash client and a remote service, usually a Flash Media Server or third party alternatives. This library provides classes for encoding and decoding from the AMF format.\n",
