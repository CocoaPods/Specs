Users saying they wish you added more superlatives??\n\n                       Simply replace NSLocalizedString with CRZLocalizedString and the power to do all of this will be yours.\n\n                       You set up an endpoint with a json file full of strings and your app will treat it like an extended .strings file.\n\n                       * Markdown format.\n                       * Don't worry about the indent, we strip it!\n",
