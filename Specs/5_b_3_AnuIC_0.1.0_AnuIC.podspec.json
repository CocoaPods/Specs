  "description": "Anu Intelligent Compression is a lossy compression technique that uses JPEG Compression to shrink high resolution images to lower sizes.\n\nWe use an unique compression algorithm to iteratively compress images such that the quality of the image is not compramised visibly. With this, an image of size around MB can finally be bought to less than 50KB, with an invisible loss of quality.\n\nAn uncompressed image of size 3.8 MB",
