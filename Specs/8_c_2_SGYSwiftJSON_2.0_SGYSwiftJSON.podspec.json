  "summary": "A library seeking to provide an automatic and type-safe approach to converting Swift models to and from JSON.",
  "description": "SGYSwiftJSON seeks to dramatically simplify serialization and deserialization of Swift model to and from JSON. While serialization is fully supported, the primary goal is to go beyond simple key-value coding to provide a system for creating properly typed object graphs from JSON. This includes recursive conversion of types contained in collections, dictionaries, and complex objects. Out-of-the-box functionality includes support for the majority of common Foundation types and a ready to inherit base class for complex types (not required, but easier). Protocols are provided which allow extending functionality to unusual objects.",
