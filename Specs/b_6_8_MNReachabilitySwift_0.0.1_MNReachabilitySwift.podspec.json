Such as the famous repository Reachability.\nBUT we really need a tool for us to get the reachability, not the local connection!\nApple doc tells us something about SCNetworkReachability API: \"Note that reachability does not guarantee that the data packet will actually be received by the host.\"\nThe called \"reachability\" we already know can only tell us the local connection status.These tools currently we know are all supported by the SCNetworkReachability API.\nNow Reachability in swift check the net real can connect to server.",
