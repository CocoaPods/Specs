  "description": "Jayme defines a neat architecture for REST management in your Swift code. The idea behind this library is to separate concerns: Your view controllers should handle neither networking code nor heavy business logic code, in order to stay lightweight. The library provides a neat API to deal with REST communication, as well as default implementations for basic CRUD functionality and pagination.",
