  "description": "This observable collection works just likes any other providing collection changed events on insertions and deletions. Where this differs is that each element must implement the NotifyChanged protocol discussed below. This allows not only to received event's if elements are inserted but receive events for object's that implement the NotifyChanged Protocol any time a Variable is modified.",
