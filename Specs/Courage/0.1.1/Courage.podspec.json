  "description": "The Courage iOS client is designed to received realtime events from\na Courage service endpoint.\n\nThe Courage service was invented to fulfill a specific niche in realtime\ndelivery. Whereas other systems promise only best-effort delivery for\nactively connected clients, Courage:\n\n- Guarantees eventual delivery of all messages\n- Supports server-to-many-device event channels\n- Is a generalized interface to Android, iOS and Web clients\n- Has a fallback for actively connected devices to use the APNS\n  silent sync feature\n- Will attempt to reconnect if the active connection is lost\n\nLimitations:\n\n- In-order delivery is impossible, and cannot be guaranteed\n- Message size limit of 1kB\n\nThis client library must be used with the Courage service.",
