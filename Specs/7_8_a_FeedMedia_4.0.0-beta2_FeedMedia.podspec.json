  "description": "Feed.fm allows you to legally add popular music to your mobile app with a Pandora-style\n  user interface. This SDK takes care of all communication with the Feed.fm service and\n  delivery of music files to the iOS device - you need only set authentication tokens\n  and call play, pause, skip, like or dislike on the shared player instance.\n\n  This pod also contains a collection of UI elements that build on top of the core library.\n  Sample elements include: play/pause, skip, and like/dislike buttons that update themselves\nautomatically; UILabels that marquee and display the active song; and others.\n\n  This pod includes an example app that can be used with 'pod try FeedMedia'\n  Documentation for the classes in this package can be found at\n\n  http://demo.feed.fm/sdk/docs/ios\n\n  For a more full featured demo app, look at https://github.com/feedfm/iOS-RadioPlayer",
