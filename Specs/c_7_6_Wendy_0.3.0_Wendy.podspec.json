  "description": "Wendy is an iOS library designed to help you make your app offline-first. Use Wendy to define sync tasks, then Wendy will run those tasks periodically to keep your app's device offline data in sync with it's online remote storage.\n\nWendy is a FIFO task runner. You give it tasks, one by one, it persists those tasks to storage, then when Wendy has determined it's a good time for your task to run, it will call your task's sync function to perform a sync. If your user's device is online and has a good amount of battery, Wendy goes through all of the tasks available one by one running them to succeed or fail and try again.",
