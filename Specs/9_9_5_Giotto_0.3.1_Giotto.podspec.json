  "description": "SDThemeManager (henceforth called TM) is born mainly with the intention of simplifying and standardizing development of applications that require the rebranding of the GUI.\nThe plist describing a theme must contain a Constants dictionary with all constants, while styles can be arranged as desired in other dictionaries. It contains all constants such as font names, colors, or sizes. Technically it is a one level organized dictionary.\nAt the same level as Constants, other dictionaries can be defined as function groups of graphic styles. Group names are free.",
