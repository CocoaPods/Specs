  "description": "                   DLWidgetMenu is a versatile solution for displaying widget menus and can easily be extended with custom layouts and/or animations\n\n                   ## Features\n\n                   DLWidgetMenu** comes with three built-in layouts:\n                   \n                   * `DLWMLinearLayout`\n                   * `DLWMRadialLayout`\n                   * `DLWMSpiralLayout`\n                   \n                   **DLWidgetMenu** uses iOS7's **spring animations** (`DLWMSpringMenuAnimator`) by default, but can easily be provided with your own **custom animations** as well (by subclassing `DLWMMenuAnimator`).\n                   \n                   **DLWidgetMenu** observes its menu items for these **gesture recognizer events**:\n                   \n                   * single tap\n                   * double tap\n                   * long press\n                   * pan\n                   * pinch\n                   \n                   and **forwards them** directly to its **delegate**.\n",
