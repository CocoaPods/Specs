Includes classes for video playing, and ALAssets.\n\n                   * Think: Why did you write this? What is the focus? What does it do?\n                   * CocoaPods will be using this to generate tags, and improve search results.\n                   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.\n                   * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!\n",
