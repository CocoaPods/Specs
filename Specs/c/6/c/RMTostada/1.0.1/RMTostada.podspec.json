  "description": "RMTostada framework provides methods to display multiple tostadas views (toast views) with different styles.\nRMTostada is capable to display more than one tostada view at the same time, every tostada view will be appended to a queue.\nWhen a tostada view will be dismissed, all the subsequent tostadas views on the queue (on the screen) will be shifted.\nBasically there are three different tostadas views:\n\n    - Self dismissed: These tostadas views will be dismissed automatically after a time interval.\n    - Manually dismissed: These tostadas needs to be dismissed manually calling dismissWithId and sending the id of the tostada to dismiss.\n    - Manually dismissed with activity indicator: Same as Manually dismissed just that these will include an UIActivityIndicatorView at the end of the text.\n\nAll the tostadas will be displayed on the rootViewController view, if there is one.\n\nThis framework is based on Toast-Swift pod by Charles Scalesse (https://github.com/scalessec/Toast-Swift).",
