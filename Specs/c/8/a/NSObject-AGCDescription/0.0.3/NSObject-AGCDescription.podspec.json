  "description": "It's boring to write description methods. It's even more boring to keep them updated everytime you modify a class. But great descriptions can improve the quality of your debugging... and save you time! Don't worry! It's time to let AGCDescriptiondo the dirty work for you! AGCDescription is a category on NSObject which uses the Objective-c runtime potential to automatically build the description string of any of your classes. And if you gonna change the class, the description will be automatically updated.",
