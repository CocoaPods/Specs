  "summary": "A view controller that uses root views of child view controllers as views in a UIStackView.",
  "description": "This view controller is more suitable than an UITableViewController when creating a list of segments that are dynamically behaving, but are well defined and bound in number. The delegation pattern that the data source of an UITableViewController is best suited for situation when there is an unbounded number of cells, but in many cases is an overkill and becomes a burden. Also, UITableViewCells are not controllers, but sometimes it makes sense to properly partition the responsibility of the segments, not just over the view layer. Using ScrollingStackViewController you can have a bunch of view controllers, each of them encapsulating their own responsibilities.",
