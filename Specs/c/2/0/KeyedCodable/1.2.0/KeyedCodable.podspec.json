  "description": "KeyedCodable is an addition to swift's Codable introduced in swift 4. It?s great we can use automatic implementation of Codable methods but when we have to implement them manually it often brings boilerplate code - especially when we need to implement both encoding and decoding methods for complicated JSON's structure.\nThe goal it to make manual implementation of Encodable/Decodable easier, more readable, less boilerplate and what is the most important fully compatible with 'standard' Codable.",
