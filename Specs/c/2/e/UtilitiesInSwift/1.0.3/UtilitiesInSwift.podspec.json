  "description": "Utility functions for swift that have been created through the years.  Some converted from other languages.  \nThe utilities are broken down by type categories (I did what I thought was ok).\n  \n  * Queues         --> I mainly created these so as Swift morphs, I can easily adjust the function bodies and not all over the code base, plus, I may want to add later functionality.\n  * NumberToWords  --> Convert decimal values to words for use in writing a check.  Cause we all write checks these days....\n  * SendLocalAlert --> A simple way to send and stop local alerts",
