  "description": "Himotoki (紐解き) is a type-safe JSON decoding library purely written in Swift. This library is highly inspired by popular JSON parsing libraries in Swift: [Argo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo) and [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper).\n\n_Himotoki_ has the same meaning of 'decoding' in Japanese.\n\n- Just do JSON decoding (deserialization) well. JSON encoding (serialization) would not be supported going forward. :wink:\n- Much simpler API.\n- Fail-fast conditional model building. This is useful for some `struct`s with non-optional `let` properties.\n- No external dependencies.",
