  "description": "The iOS documentation says that when an app goes into the background, certain things should happen to avoid confusion when it comes back into the foreground. One of those things is cancelling UIActionSheet's and UIAlertView's.\n\nThis project does exactly that automatically. As an added bonus, I also added some init methods with blocks rather than delegates.\n",
