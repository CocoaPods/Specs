  "description": "A helper for creating infinite and bounded Date sequences. It was created to generate ISO-8601 dash-separated date strings for SQLite queries, but can also be used in most places where evenly-spaced Dates are needed. Any `Calendar.Component` can be used, but the API is designed with intervals of at least a whole day in mind.",
