  "description": "Monstra is a thread-safe, high-performance task executor that ensures only one instance\nof a task runs at a time while providing intelligent result caching and retry capabilities.\n\nFeatures:\n- Execution Merging: Multiple concurrent requests are merged into a single execution\n- TTL-based Caching: Results are cached for a configurable duration\n- Retry Logic: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed executions\n- Thread Safety: Full thread safety with fine-grained locking using semaphores\n- Queue Management: Separate queues for task execution and callback invocation\n- Manual Cache Control: Manual cache invalidation with execution strategy options",
