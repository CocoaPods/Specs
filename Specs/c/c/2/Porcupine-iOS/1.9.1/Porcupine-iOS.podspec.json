  "description": "Porcupine is a highly-accurate and lightweight wake word engine. It enables building always-listening voice-enabled applications. \n\nPorcupine is:\n  * using deep neural networks trained in real-world environments.\n  * compact and computationally-efficient. It is perfect for IoT.\n  * cross-platform. Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, Android, iOS, Linux (x86_64), macOS (x86_64), Windows (x86_64), and web browsers are supported. Additionally, enterprise customers have access to ARM Cortex-M SDK.\n  * scalable. It can detect multiple always-listening voice commands with no added runtime footprint.\n  * self-service. Developers can train custom wake word models using Picovoice Console.",
