  "description": "                    The YUGLTransition is a library that lets you create GPU-based transition to UIView and UIViewController.\n\n                    It uses GPUImage for the rendering part.\n\n                    There're some ready-to-use transition effects, like ripple, swap, doorway, flash, flyeye, etc. And it allows you to create your own custom transitions by providing your custom transition filter.\n",
