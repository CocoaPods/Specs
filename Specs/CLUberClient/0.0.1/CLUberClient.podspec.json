  "description": "This is a very simple iOS Objective-C wrapper around NSURLSession\nfor use in accessing the Uber RESTful API:\n\nhttps://developer.uber.com/docs/api-overview\n\nSo far the only calls implemented are:\n\n   1. List Products\n   2. Get time estimates\n\nAlthough simple, it's a nice starting point for someone getting\nstarted with the Uber API. It has a few niceties like handling\nthe auth token, localization request based on the user's current\nlocale, and automatically switching to the proper Uber API endpoint\nin China when needed.",
