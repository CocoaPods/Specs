  "description": "I figure if you're using a block, you probably won't need to pass any userinfo object into the timer... you can get to whatever you need just from the block. So, I just hijack the +scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:target:selector:userInfo:repeats: class method and it's brother -init..., setting it to use itself as the target, and to execute the class method +jdExecuteSimpleBlock: (which is part of the category) then pass the block you specify as the userInfo object which is then uses in the execute method. Pretty straightforward stuff.\n",
