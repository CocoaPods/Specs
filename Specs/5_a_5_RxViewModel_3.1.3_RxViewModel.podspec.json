  "description": "`RxViewModel` is the marriage between `MVVM` and `Rx` extensions\n\nSince [`ReactiveViewModel`](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveViewModel) project felt on stagnation and there's not `Swift` or `Swift 2.0` implementation we found the need to implement something like this on `Swift`.\n\nGiven the fact that there's no `Swift` branch and the lack of interest in the project we felt it was better to give `RxSwift`/`RxCocoa` a chance and instead use it as the base for this reactive view model approach.\n\nLong story short: a blatant «imitation» of `ReactiveViewModel `using `RxCocoa`.",
