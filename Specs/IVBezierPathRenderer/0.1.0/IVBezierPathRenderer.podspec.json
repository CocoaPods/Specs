  "description": "MapKit framework provide us useful classes for drawing simple path in MKMapView. \nHowever, those lines draw with MKPolylineRenderer are too plat and unstylized, and most importantly, no bezier path, which is not sufficient for my map application usage. \nTherefore, IVBezierPathRenderer is created for more natural map path drawing.",
