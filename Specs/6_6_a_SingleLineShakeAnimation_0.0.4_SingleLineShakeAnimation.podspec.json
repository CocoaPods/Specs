  "description": "                      With this non-intrusive UIView extension, your UIView subclasses can get shaking with very little code.\n                      Shaking can be useful to indicate an important action your user needs to perform, for example filling out a form before submitting.\n                      Show the user it by gently shaking the needed view to get their attention.\n",
