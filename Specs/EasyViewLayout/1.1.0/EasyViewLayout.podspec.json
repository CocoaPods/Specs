For those who choose not to use IB and would rather\n                        use code to layout view, the idea of this tool is to make constraints less painful and more readable.\n                        Feel free to add/remove as you see fit but use it as your own risk.\n\n                       * Markdown format.\n                       * Don't worry about the indent, we strip it!\n",
