  "description": "Produces a curried version of almost any other function. Just wrap your function in a single call ‘curry(myFunction)’ and the result will be a curried version of your original. A useful tool for working with parser combinators and other functional programming work. Currently supports up to 14 parameters. Pull requests for improvements are welcome.",
