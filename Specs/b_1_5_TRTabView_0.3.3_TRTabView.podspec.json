  "description": "                   A flexible implementation of a tabbed view like the one in Safari for iPad. It uses a delegate design pattern that is inspired by the UITableView delegate and data source methods.\n                   \n                   Tab reordering, overflow behavior, the minimum/maximum number of tabs, the minimum/maximum tab widths and much more are easy configurable by implementing the corresponding delegate calls.\n                   \n                   For most settings there is a reasonable default already provided.\n                   Display orientation changes are supported out of the box.\n                   \n                   See https://github.com/mkeiser/TRTabView for an example project.\n                   \n",
