  "description": "RuntimeKit is a Swift library for accessing the Objective-C runtime.\nIn addition to providing wrappers around features like method swizzling or associated values, it also provides some type safety.\n\nAs of right now, RuntimeKit only supports method swizzling, replacing a methods implementation with a block and setting associated objects. More features will be added over time.",
