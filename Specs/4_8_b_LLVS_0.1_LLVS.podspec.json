  "description": "Ever wish it was as easy to move your app's data around as it is to push and pull \nyour source code with a tool like Git? \n\nLLVS works like a standard key-value store, except that it attaches a version to\nevery piece of stored data â€” it forms a complete history of changes. \nJust as with Git, you can retrieve the values for \nany version, determine the differences between two versions, \nand merge divergent versions.\n\nLLVS is also decentralized: you can send and receive versions from other stores, \nin the same way that you push and pull from other repositories with Git.",
