Yet it is in a way bit easy you work with, if you get an hold of how it actaully work, working with only model calsses to update the database structre on the fly.\n                       And for those who hate to use Core Data, FMDB is you best choice. But still it lack the capability of mapping objects to models. So you  have to manullay create the databas and queries, ah.\n                       So I develop this Libaray as an wrapper library to FMDB, that handle the database, table & all other CRUD function that we use daily. To make you life easire.\n                       This libaray is still at it early stages (not even Alpha) so you are always welcome to teak thigs here and there to make this better :). \n                       \n                       Happy Coding.\n\n                       * Markdown format.\n                       * Don't worry about the indent, we strip it!\n",
