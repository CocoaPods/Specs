  "description": "SynqHttp is a networking library to be used when making http calls to a web server. This library is an example of the network methods needed to serve the Synq client libraries, and you can use it to get started with testing the Synq client libraries.\n\nTo be able to test the library you need to clone the Node server example in this repository: https://github.com/SYNQfm/synq-node-server. By following the instructions you will be able to setup your own local Node server that will also communicate with the Synq API. Please note: this code is intended as an example of how to build the communication between your app and your server. Do not use this code in production.",
