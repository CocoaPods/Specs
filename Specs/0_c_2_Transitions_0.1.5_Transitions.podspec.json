  "description": "Transitions library provides an easy way to present different view controllers with a transition animation, which may be interactive, by just subclassing your view controller.\nBy subclassing your view controller with the right transition controller, you will be able to present/dismiss, push/pop, select, a new view controller with a custom *interactive* animation with a simple call, without having to worry about implementing any `UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning` or `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`.",
