  "description": "# SnapLayout\nConcise API for iOS Auto Layout. SnapLayout extends `UIView` to deliver a list of APIs to improve\n readability while also shortening constraint code. Internally uses AutoLayout to provide the best \n experience. With SnapLayout, developers can remove boilerplate code but not at the cost of readability.\n\nImagine applying any or all of the following constraints in one line of code: top, leading, trailing, \nbottom, width, height, centerX, centerY. This is possible with `SnapLayout`.",
