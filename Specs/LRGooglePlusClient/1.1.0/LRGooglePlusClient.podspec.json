  "description": "                       LRGoogle Plus Client was created to simplify the integration of Google Plus framework into an iOS App.\n\nSince the Google documentation is pretty extensive, but not always that clear - I went onwards with creating a simpler solution - a singleton class that does anything from logging in , one line sharing and properly notifying you on various events.\n\nI find this solution much easier to implement and maintain as it also removes a lot of the overhead when copying this solution from project to project.\n\nThe less code you duplicate and write - the less bugs you will have.\n",
