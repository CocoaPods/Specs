  "description": "The idea behind this is that especially for new developers who don't have their own designers, there's a lot if iteration involved in making good looking views, and for them it might be a lot easier to tweak a number than to go back and make half of the stripes in a view to be a slightly different shade of blue. This is about making iteration and design easy for developers.",
