  "description": "SBJson implements a strict JSON parser and generator in\nObjective-C. Its primary feature is stream/chunk-based\noperation: feed it one or more chunks of UTF8-encoded data and\nit will call a block you provide with each root-level document\nor array. Or, optionally, for each top-level entry in each\nroot-level array.\n\nWith this you can reduce the apparent latency for each\ndownload/parse cycle of documents over a slow connection. You\ncan start parsing *and return chunks of the parsed document*\nbefore the full document has downloaded. You can also parse\nmassive documents bit by bit so you don't have to keep them\nall in memory.",
