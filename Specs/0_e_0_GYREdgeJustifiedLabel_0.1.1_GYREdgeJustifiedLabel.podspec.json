  "description": "EdgeJustifiedLabel is a UILabel subclass which allows two strings to be shown left and right justified on a single line, and equally scaled or truncated to fit the label bounds.\nThis capability is not possible using two separate UILabels and autolayout, as one will always scale before the other, nor is it possible via NSAttributedString, which does not allow left and right justified text to be displayed on a single line.\nAdditional options include minimum spacing between the strings, and truncation styles for each string once scaling options have been exhausted.",
