  "description": "This is a relatively universal, drop-in solution: UIScrollView and UITableView subclasses that handle everything.When the keyboard is about to appear, the subclass will find the subview that's about to be edited, and adjust its frame and content offset to make sure that view is visible, with an animation to match the keyboard pop-up. When the keyboard disappears, it restores its prior size.",
