  "description": "                      * No need to pull and release. Just pull far enough and a refresh will trigger. You'll see much more of these soon.\n                      * Adjust tint color of arrow.\n                      * No support for last refresh date.\n                      * Built on top of UIControl. When triggered it sends a UIControlEventValueChanged event to targets.\n                      * View has a magical height of 44 points.\n                      * iOS 5 and up (yeah, that's a feature).\n",
