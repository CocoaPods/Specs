  "description": "JDFNavigationBarActivityIndicator is a UIView subclass that provides an easy, space-effective way to show an activity indicator on a UINavigationBar.\n \nIt is visually similar in concept to the progress indicator shown in iOS Safari, in that it appears as a thin, animating line at the bottom of a navigation bar. The difference is that it is an indeterminate progress indicator, making it useful for when you don't know the completion progress of a task.\n",
