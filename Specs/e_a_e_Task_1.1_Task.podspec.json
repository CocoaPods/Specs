  "description": "                   Task is a simple Cocoa framework for expressing and executing your application’s\n                   workflows. Using Task, you need only express each step in your workflow — called\n                   tasks — and what their prerequisite tasks are. After that, the framework handles\n                   the mechanics of executing the steps in the correct order with the appropriate\n                   level of concurrency, letting you know when tasks finish or fail. It also makes\n                   it easy to cancel tasks, retry failed tasks, and re-run previously completed\n                   tasks and workflows.\n",
