  "description": "__Faro__ is a service layer built in Swift by using generics. We focussed on:\n*Service*\n* Service written to use Swift without using the Objective-C runtime\n* Service cleanly encapsulates all the parameters to handle a network request in `Call`.\n* Easily write a 'MockService' to load JSON from a local drive\n\n*Automagically Parse*\n* Use our Deserialization and Serialization operators to parse relations and properties\n\n*Protocols*\n* Because we use Protocols you can use any type including CoreData's `NSManagedObject` ðŸ’ª\n\n*Mocking*\n* Use `FaroService` singleton if you want to switch between data from the server or a file.\n* Handy for unit tests ðŸ’ª\n* Handy if API is not yet available ðŸ¤“",
