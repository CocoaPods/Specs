  "description": "NSDate+RelativeTime\n===================\n\nNSDate+RelativeTime is an `NSDate` category to generate relative time (or fuzzy\ntime) strings from dates. NSDate's are parsed to strings like for example\n'Now', 'A day ago' or '3 months from now'. NSDate+RelativeTime seperates\nitself from other alike categories in the fact that it handles not only past\ndates but future dates as well.\n\n## Usage\n* Import `NSDate+RelativeTime.h` into the class.\n* Call the `relativeTime` method on an NSDate to get the relative time.\n\n## Tests\nThe tests are in `NSDate+RelativeTimeTests.m` and require Kiwi to run.\n",
