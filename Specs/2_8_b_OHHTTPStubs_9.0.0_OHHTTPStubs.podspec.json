  "description": "A class to stub network requests easily:\n\n * Test your apps with fake network data (stubbed from file)\n * You can also customize your response headers and status code\n * Use customized stubs depending on the requests\n * Use custom response time to simulate slow network.\n * This works with any request (HTTP, HTTPS, or any protocol) sent using\n   the iOS URL Loading System (NSURLConnection, NSURLSession, AFNetworking, â€¦)\n * This is really useful in unit testing, when you need to test network features\n   but don't want to hit the real network and fake some response data instead.\n * Has useful convenience methods to stub JSON content or fixture from a file\n * Compatible with Swift",
