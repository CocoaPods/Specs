  "description": "November provides a set of extensions to `Date` and `DateFormatter` to build a nice API which simplify the conversion from `Date` to `Strin and back.\n\nCreating a `NSDateFormatter` is an expensive task. For this reason, **November** takes care of caching the created `DateFormatter` in order to reuse them along the lifecycle of your app.",
