  "description": "YMTreeMap is a high performance treemap layout engine for iOS and macOS, written in Swift.\n\nTree maps (also called Heat Maps) are one or multi-dimensional graphical deprictions of\nvalues using rectangles. The primary dimension is the area of each rectangle, which\nrepresents the relative size of that value compared to the other values.\n\nAnother popular dimension is the treatment of inner area of the rectangles (generally\nusing color or shading).\n\nTree maps and heat maps are very popular in the financial sector, and this library\nwas designed for use in the Yahoo Finance iOS app.\n\nGenerating a tree-map requires nothing more than a list of positive numbers and\na rectangle to layout within.",
