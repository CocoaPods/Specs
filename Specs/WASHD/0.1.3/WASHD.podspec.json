  "description": "WASHD (What Apple Should Have Done) adds some very basic, oft-used enhancements to (mainly) UITextFields. Usign Interface Builder, you can add Validation, a max length, a format, and something we call 'jump order' (when hitting \"Return\", the next UITextField by jump order will become the firstResponder).  Lastly, you can jump to the next UITextField when formatting has been fulfilled or when a max length has been reached.  All of this will make your form making much better for your users, and easier on you.",
