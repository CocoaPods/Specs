  "summary": "A super lightweight framework for building and integrating loadable modules",
  "description": "AppModules addresses the problem of distributed development in environments where a common repository is impossible for legal\nor practical reasons.  Developers can create, maintain, and test Modules which can be incorporated easily into other applications\nby those other applications' developers.  The relationship between a Module and its application, or between Modules within\nan application, is loosely modeled upon the REST pattern.  A Module is addressable by its containing application (or by other\nmodules) using HTTP verbs (currently GET is implemented).",
