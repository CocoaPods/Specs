  "summary": "A lightweight framework which makes KVO easily to use.",
  "description": "KVO is very troublesome to use, you need to call addObserver: method, override method\nto observe the event. All I need is when there is somthing changed, execute blocks.\nAt first ReactiveCocoa fits my requirement, and I really had a happy time with it. But\nit is a swift framework and doesn't officially support cocoapods as installation method.\nOKObserver is created under this circumstance to help us bind model and view.",
