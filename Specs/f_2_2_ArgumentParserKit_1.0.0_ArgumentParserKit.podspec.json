  "description": "I think the ArgumentParser Apple hides inside their Swift Package Manager deserves more. That's why I extracted the relevant source code into a Pod to make it available to a larger audience.\nThe ArgumentParser offers a type-safe and easy way to parse arguments given via the command line to your program. Keep in mind that Apple itself makes clear that you use this private and maybe unstable API at your own risk.",
