  "description": "While Apple has done an incredible job with UIView Animations and Core Animation, there are sometimes cases that are difficult to get around. PRTween is a great alternative if you'd like to: Animate a property Core Animation won't allow you to Ensure that [someView layoutSubviews] is respected during an animation Tween arbitrary numerical values, such as sound volume, scroll position, a counter, or many others Define your timing curve as a function rather than a bezier with control points PRTween aims to be as simple as possible without sacrificing flexibility. In many cases, an animation may be as simple as: [PRTween tween:someView property:@\"alpha\" from:1 to:0 duration:3]; In order to promote simplicity, PRTween can be used as a drop-in replacement for most animations in your app. This means that in the case displayed above, the end result is identical to writing a UIView animation yourself.",
