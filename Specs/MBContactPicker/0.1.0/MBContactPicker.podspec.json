  "description": "                   MBContactPicker is a library that uses the latest styling and technologies\n                   available on iOS.\n\n                   I wrote this library to provide an update to the awesome THContactPicker that\n                   our company used in the past. My main goal when I created this library was to build\n                   something that behaved and felt like the native mail app's contact selector.\n\n                   My secondary goal was to make using it extremely simple while still providing \n                   a high level of flexibility for projects that need it.\n",
