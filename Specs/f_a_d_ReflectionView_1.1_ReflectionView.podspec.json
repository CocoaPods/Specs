  "description": "ReflectionView is a UIView subclass designed to make it easy to create \"mirrored floor\"-style reflections of views on iOS.\n\n  You may have noticed that Apple provides a Reflection sample project for this, but Apple's solution works only with images and involves fairly slow CPU-bound drawing to update the reflection, making it unsuitable for reflecting animated content. ReflectionView can operate in two modes; static mode - which works like Apple's sample code - or dynamic mode, which uses Core Animation and works in real-time on any view. This means you can use it to reflect the contents of a view containing dynamic elements such as controls or animation and the reflection will keep up in real-time.",
