  "description": "In iOS 7, Apple introduced the possibility to [execute JavaScript via the JavaScriptCore JavaScript\nengine] (http://nshipster.com/javascriptcore/). Unfortunately, JavaScriptCore is missing some\nobjects and functions a JavaScript environment of a browser would have. Especially the\n`XMLHTTPRequest` (see the [Mozilla documentation]\n(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) object needed for AJAX reqeuests\nis not provided by JavaScriptCore. This library implements this missing object, so it is possible to\nuse JavaScript libraries which were originally developed for in-browser use in your Objective-C\n(or Swift) application without the need to use a hidden WebView.",
