  "description": "This a library for creating percentage-based margins between views and their superviews in iOS. It allows, for example, to create an Auto Layout constraint for the trailing margin of 20% between the view and its superview. Because the margin is percentage-based its absolute size will adapt automatically when the superview size changes.",
