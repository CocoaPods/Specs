  "description": "iCloudSync is a fork of iCloud Document Sync Framework by iRare Media. Original\nframework was done under MIT license, so this one follows MIT licensing.\n\niCloudSync makes it incredibly simple to integrate iCloud document storage\nAPIs into iOS applications. This is how iCloud document-storage and \nmanagement should've been out of the box from Apple. Integrate iCloud\ninto iOS Swift document projects with one-line code methods.\nSync, upload, manage, and remove documents to and from iCloud with\nonly a few lines of code (compared to the hundreds of lines and hours \nthat it usually takes). Get iCloud up and running in your iOS app in\nonly a few minutes.",
