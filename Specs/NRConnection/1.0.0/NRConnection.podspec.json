  "description": "NRConnection: lets use the network layer in the simplest way. Send/Get parameters,images and videos from/to server in a simplest way. Well there are various network classes available for open source, but most of them missing the simplicity . NRConnection allows developer to post parameters, images and videos in a simplest way. Just a single method for video and images which needs the array of images and videos and NRConnection sends it to the server in a most elegant way with the use of Alamofire. You can get the success/failure with the help of NRCompletionHandler.\n.",
