  "description": "Cyanic is a MvRx and Epoxy inspired framework that aims to build reactive UI in a UICollectionView/UITableView.\nIt borrows heavily from MvRx in terms of API and structure while falling within the constraints of\nSwift and iOS development. It leverages RxSwift to have reactive functionality, LayoutKit to have\nperformance close to manual layout when sizing and arranging subviews, and Sourcery for fast creation of\ncustom components. It uses an Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) style of architecture.",
