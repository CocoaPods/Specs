  "summary": "A Swift class for initiating segues programmatically, using closures for view controller preparation",
  "description": "A downside of UIViewController's performSegue(withIdentifier:sender:) is that\nconfiguration of the presented view controller must occur separately in\nprepare(for:sender:) instead of locally at the call site. This\ncan become particularly awkward in the context of multiple segues.\nSeguePerformer improves upon this by providing\npeformSegue(withIdentifier:sender:preparationHandler:), which allows for\nconfiguration of the new view controller via a trailing closure parameter.",
