  "description": "iCloudSync is a fork of iCloudDocumentSync Framework by iRare Media. Original\nframework was done under MIT license, so this one follows MIT licensing.\n\nWhat is different in iCloudSync and iCloudDocumentSync?\nWell, mostly that iCloudSync is a complete rewrite, and original version was\nwritten in Objective-C, when this is written in pure Swift.\nSome things are different, but I have tried to keep up with original\nfunctionality.\n\niCloudSync makes it credibly simple to integrate iCloud document storage\nAPIs into iOS applications. This is how iCloud document-storage and \nmanagement should've been out of the box from Apple. Integrate iCloud\ninto iOS Swift document projects with one-line code methods.\nSync, upload, manage, and remove documents to and from iCloud with\nonly a few lines of code (compared to the hundreds of lines and hours \nthat it usually takes). Get iCloud up and running in your iOS app in\nonly a few minutes.",
