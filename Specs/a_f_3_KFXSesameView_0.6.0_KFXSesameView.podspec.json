  "description": "Open Sesame!\n\nThe basic idea is to have a hidden keypad in your app that can be used to unlock a secret part area for example a debug mode or an easter egg. Provides a single class: KFXSesameView which contains a UICollectionView. The collection view is used to layout a grid of cells and each cell can be added to a sequence of taps. Tap all in the seqence within a time limit and get a delegate callback. Then you can present a new view controller or do whatever you want.",
