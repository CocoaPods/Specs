  "description": "Are you tired of waiting for your app to compile and sync to your device when you just want to update an image or some text? Wouldnâ€™t it be wonderful if you could distribute your application over the air and the copywriter could edit the localization files directly? Imagine if you could give your app to a designer who could tweak the layouts, fonts, margins and colours, without needing an Xcode installation or any knowledge of Objective-C? With the ResourceManager framework, combined with AppCoreKit and a few lines of code, all this is possible.",
