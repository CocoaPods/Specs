  "description": "\t\t\t\t\tTLIndexPathTools is a small set of classes that can greatly simplify your table and collection views. Here are some of the awesome things TLIndexPathTools does:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t* Organize data into sections with ease (now with blocks!)\n\t\t\t\t\t* Calculate and perform animated batch updates (inserts, moves and deletions)\n\t\t\t\t\t* Simplify data source and delegate methods via rich data model APIs\n\t\t\t\t\t* Provide a simpler alternative to Core Data NSFetchedResultsController\n\t\t\t\t\t* Provide base table view and collection view classes with advanced features\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t0.3.0\n\t\t\t\t\t* Enhancements to the Collapse extension\n                        * `CollapsibleTableViewController` integrates with Core Data out-of-the-box.\n                      One only needs to replace the default `TLIndexPathController with an\n                      instance initialized with an `NSFetchRequest`.\n                        * Add `TLCollapsibleDataModel` initialize that takes a collection\n                          of expanded section names (instead of collapsed section names)\n                    * Add completion handler to `performBatchUpdatesOnTableView`\n                    * Add `TLDynamicHeightLabelCell` extension, a simple table view cell\n                      implementation supporting a single dynamic height label\n                    * Modified items are now reloaded in `performBatchUpdatesOnCollectionView`\n                    * Add ability to pause and unpause fetch results updates by setting the\n                      `ignoreFetchedResultsChanges` property on `TLIndexPathController`\n                    * The notification `TLIndexPathControllerChangedNotification` has been\n                      renamed to `kTLIndexPathControllerChangedNotification`\n",
