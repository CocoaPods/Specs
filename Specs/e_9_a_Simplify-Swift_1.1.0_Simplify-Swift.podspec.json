  "description": "Simplify-Swift is a high-performance Swift polyline simplification library ported from Simplify.js. The original Javascript library was extracted from Leaflet, a JS interactive maps library by Vladimir Agafonkin. It uses a combination of Douglas-Peucker and Radial Distance algorithms. Polyline simplification dramatically reduces the number of points in a polyline while retaining its shape, giving a huge performance boost when processing it and also reducing visual noise.",
