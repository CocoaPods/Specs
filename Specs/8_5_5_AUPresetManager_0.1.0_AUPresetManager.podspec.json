  "description": "Apple's esoteric format for the AUSampler audioUnit usually has to be created on a Mac.  Edited on the mac, with file references and all, then imported into an iOS project in the app bundle.  This class uses a skeleton file (created on a Mac), then is able to dynamically generate the AUPreset dictionary so that files can be loaded on the fly.",
