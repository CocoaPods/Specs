  "description": "                       It is tedious and requires very much reading in the documentation if you want to understand the ABAddressBook in iOS. To provide a solution, this wrapper uses Swift, which is strong-typed (unlike c). It also circumvents the use of unsafe c-pointers when accessing ABAddressBook from Swift, by directly casting them to the correct type. All properties, previously only available via the correct key, can now be accessed conveniently via variables.\n",
