  "description": "                      The Moodstocks SDK provides a scanner for mobile devices. It recognizes both barcodes and images. Scanning operates on the client-side which lets you create nice augmented reality overlays. Also it even works off-line thanks to a built-in, easy-to-use on-device image signatures synchronization.\n",
