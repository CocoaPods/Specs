  "description": "\n    Specta is a light-weight testing framework for Objective-C and Cocoa that\n    adds RSpec-like DSL to OCUnit. It is super quick and easy to set up, and\n    because it runs on top of OCUnit, it has an excellent Xcode integration and\n    accurate error site reporting. Use your preferred matcher and mocking\n    framework. Expecta and OCMock are recommended.\n  ",
