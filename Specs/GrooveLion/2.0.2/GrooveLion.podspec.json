Either way, it allows you to send highly targeted push notifications to your app users using sophisticated audience segmentation and analytics.\n\n\t\tAfter investment in an app, the next step is to give it a voice. A voice that can talk to each and every customer in a valuable, relevant and contextual way.\n",
