  "description": "                   XWebView is an extensible WebView which is built on top of WKWebView,\n                   the modern WebKit framework debuted in iOS 8.0. It provides fast Web\n                   runtime with carefully designed plugin API for developing sophisticated\n                   iOS native or hybrid applications.\n\n                   Plugins written in Objective-C or Swift programming language can be\n                   automatically exposed in JavaScript context. With capabilities offered\n                   by plugins, Web apps can look and behave exactly like native apps. They\n                   will be no longer a second-class citizen on iOS platform.\n",
