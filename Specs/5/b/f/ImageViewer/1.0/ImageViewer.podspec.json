  "description": "ImageViewer is a library that enables a user to visualize an image in fullscreen. Besides the typical pinch and double tap to zoom, we also provide a vertical swipe to dismiss. Finally, we try to mimic the displacement of the image from its current container into fullscreen, this feature being its main selling point.",
