  "summary": "Provides various methods and functions to deal with CGFloat on 64-bit systems (CGFLOAT_IS_DOUBLE).",
  "description": "    It's easy to forget that `CGFloat` may actually be a `double` despite it's\n    name. On 64-bit systems, where `CGFLOAT_IS_DOUBLE` is set to 1 it will actually\n    be a double.\n\n    This may become cumbersome when you are developing an application where you\n    want a single code base which builds for both 32-bit and 64-bit such as when\n    developing against the 32-bit simulator and deploying arm64.\n\n    CGFloatType is a simple pod which provides helper methods on `NSNumber` to help\n    deal with this. Along with providing various rounding, and various other math\n    functions which accept a `CGFloat`.\n",
