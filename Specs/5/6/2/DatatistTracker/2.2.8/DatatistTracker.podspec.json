  "description": "The DatatistTracker is an Objective-C framework (iOS and OSX) for sending analytics to a Datatist server.\n \n Datatist server is a downloadable, Free/Libre (GPLv3 licensed) real time web analytics software, [http://datatist.org](http://datatist.org).\n This framework implements the Datatist tracking REST API [http://datatist.org/docs/tracking-api/reference.](http://datatist.org/docs/tracking-api/reference/)\n \n ###How does it work\n \n 1. Create and configure the tracker\n 2. Track screen views, events, errors, social interaction, search, goals and more\n 3. Let the SDK dispatch events to the Datatist server automatically, or dispatch events manually\n \n All events are persisted locally in Core Data until they are dispatched and successfully received by the Datatist server.\n \n All methods are asynchronous and will return immediately.",
