  "description": "                   Custom UICollectionViewLayout that works together with a custom UICollectionViewCell to provide drag and drop for a UICollectionView. Works just like UITableView drag and drop. What's unique about this approach is that it does not need to create a \"ghost\" or \"dummy\" cell to provide the drag and drop functionality. I believe this method is simpler and less complex for the majority of use cases.\n",
