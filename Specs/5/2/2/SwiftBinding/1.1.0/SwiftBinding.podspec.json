  "description": "This is a terribly simplistic \"binding framework\" written in Swift. There's nothing super special about it...it's just glorified object wrappers that call listener functions when the values change.\n\nThis is meant to be a stand-alone library, but to see the companion UI stuff I built on top, check out https://github.com/zacharyclaysmith/SwiftBindingUI.\n\nIf you want something with way more stars and more code, please check out https://github.com/SwiftBond/Bond. It's scarily similar to this project (unintentional), but it looks to have a number of neat additions and more robust documentation. I don't like the coupling of the View and Binding code in a single project, but whatevs.\n",
