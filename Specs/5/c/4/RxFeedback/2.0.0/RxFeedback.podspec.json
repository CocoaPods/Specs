  "description": "* Straightforward\n    * If it did happen -> Event\n    * If it should happen -> Request\n    * To fulfill Request -> Feedback loop\n* Declarative\n    * System behavior is first declaratively specified and effects begin after subscribe is called => Compile time proof there are no \"unhandled states\"\n* Debugging is easier\n    * A lot of logic is just normal pure function that can be debugged using Xcode debugger, or just printing the commands.\n\n* Can be applied on any level\n    * [Entire system](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)\n    * application (state is stored inside a database, CoreData, Firebase, Realm)\n    * view controller (state is stored inside `system` operator)\n    * inside feedback loop (another `system` operator inside feedback loop)\n* Works awesome with dependency injection\n* Testing\n    * Reducer is a pure function, just call it and assert results\n    * In case effects are being tested -> TestScheduler\n* Can model circular dependencies\n* Completely separates business logic from effects (Rx).\n    * Business logic can be transpiled between platforms (ShiftJS, C++, J2ObjC)",
