  "description": "A versatile color-picker library, that was inspired from the pod 'Color-Picker-for-iOS'.\n\nThe features planned for version 1.0 are:\n\n- Manipulate 'hue' using tap and pan on a 1-d slider.\n- Manipulate 'saturation' and 'value' using tap and pan using a 2-d color-map.\n- Manually input hex-color using the keyboard on the device.\n- Lastly selected colors are available within the picker to easily pick them again, or to see colors side by side when chosing color.\n\nFuture features planned are:\n\n- Find complementing colors\n- Improved performance for generating the color-map when sliding the hue (The performance is not currently bad due to the fact that each color-pixel is 4x4 in size).\n- Integrate 'everlof/NameThatColor' so show a nice, textual name of a color as well.",
