  "description": "This is an iOS library for showing a 'no content' message over an existing view. It can be used to show a missing content message and suggest an action.\n\nFor example, consider we have an ecommerce app with a shopping cart screen that shows a list of products. If the user goes to the empty cart screen we can show an \"Empty cart\" message and a \"Search\" button.",
