  "description": "Implements the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification for protocols in Objective-C and Objective-C compatible protocols (marked \n ```@objc```) in Swift.\n\n This allows you to write your RPC function declarations and callbacks in Objective-C or Swift using native types. The proxy will create the JSON-RPC request payload object, and convert the JSON-RPC response into a callback via a block/closure.\n\n The proxy is transport independent. A client provides a conformant component that can take the request object and return the response, optionally including the JSON encoding/decoding.",
