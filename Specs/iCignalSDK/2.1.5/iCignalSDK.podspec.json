  "description": "Well, I know nobody will actually read this. But, to be a good developer I'm writing this document. This is a SDK (a.k.a Software Development Kit), which means you can build your own application with this kit much more simpler way. So, this is just a tool for you to build something of your own. This SDK will make you less painful when you play around IoT devices.\nBut this SDK will only work fully with the server that controls contents and rules. The first thing SDK does when it's started is asking to server about how this SDK will react on IoT devices. Such as 'should SDK scan iBeacon?' or 'How long interval for sending logs?'. So, without the server it's not that very useful. Well, almost nothing will work but debugging stuffs.\nSo, go to iCIGNAL and get an API key.",
