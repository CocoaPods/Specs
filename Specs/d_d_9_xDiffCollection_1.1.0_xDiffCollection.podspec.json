  "summary": "xDiffCollection serves as a data storage of hashable objects to easily add, update and delete",
  "description": "xDiffCollection operates on the concept of bins. A bin is an array and a filter. Elements tha go in those bins are hashable identifiable and equatable differentiable. \nThe filter accepts elements into a bin based on a custom logic provided via a boolean closure.  \nxDiffCollection exposes two operations: update and delete. update can also add an element if the element passes the test and the element is not previously there. \nIf the element was already there an update operation is performed and the logic in the bin is re-run to decide if this is still the appropriate bin for that updated element. If it is not, the element is deleted from the current bin and moved to a bin where the updated element passes another's bin logic.",
