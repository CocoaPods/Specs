  "summary": "Add the missing network activity indicator on iPhone X",
  "description": "iPhones with a notch such as X, XS, XR, 11, 11 Pro don't display the network activity\nindicator anymore. This pod brings it back by placing an activity indicator in the \nupper left of the screen on top of the regular status bar items. Since a circular\nndicator wouldn't fit, a rectangular \"KITT scanner\" like indicator with a gradient is \nshown. The indicator UI can be used standalone or as a \"fix\" for the iOS network \nactivity indicator (using the existing API).",
