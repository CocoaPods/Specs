  "description": "# Problem\n\nUIStackView is a very handy tool to build flow layout, but it's available only when iOS9+, we've found some great compatible replacements like OAStackView, but we want more:  \n\n- **Perfect downward compatible**, no infectivity, use UIStackView **directly** as if it's shipped from iOS6.\n- **Interface builder support**, live preview.\n- Keep layout constraints as closely as UIStackView constructs.\n\n# Usage\n\n**Import nothing, learn nothing, it just works.**\n\n- It will automatically replace the symbol for UIStackView into FDStackView at runtime before iOS9. \n\n``` objc\n// Works in iOS6+, use it directly.\nUIStackView *stackView = [[UIStackView alloc] init];\nstackView.axis = UILayoutConstraintAxisHorizontal;\nstackView.distribution = UIStackViewDistributionFill;\nstackView.alignment = UIStackViewAlignmentTop;\n[stackView addArrangedSubview:[[UILabel alloc] init]];\n[self.view addSubview:stackView];\n```\n\n- Interface Builder Support\n\nSet `Builds for` option to `iOS 9.0 and later` to eliminate the version error in Xcode:\n\n![How to use in IB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forkingdog/FDStackView/master/Snapshots/snapshot0.png)\n\nNow, use UIStackView as you like and its reactive options and live preview: \n\n![UIStackView preview in IB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forkingdog/FDStackView/master/Snapshots/snapshot1.png)\n\n# Requirements\n\n- Xcode 7+ (For interface builder supports and the latest Objective-C Syntax)\n- Base SDK iOS 9.0+ (To link UIStackView symbol in UIKit)",
