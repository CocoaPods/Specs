  "description": "                       AsyncOpKit helps manage asynchronous operations.\n\n                       * AsyncOperation is a Swift NSOperation subclass that handles\n                       the boilerplate necessary for asynchronous NSOperations. Just\n                       override main() and don't forget to finish your operation.\n                       * AsyncOperation also provides a helpful result handler that\n                       fires on a queue of your choosing (default mainQueue) and lets\n                       you provide result value and error.\n                       * AsyncClosuresOperation is an AsyncOperation subclass that\n                       lets you manage asynchronous work inside of closures. It's similar\n                       to NSBlockOperation, but but closures/blocks do not finish until\n                           you mark them as complete.\n",
