  "description": "AsyncOpKit brings Swift generics, error handling, and closures to NSOperations with `AsyncOp`, a Swift-only generic NSOperation subclass for composing asynchronous code.\n`AsyncOp` supports:\n\n* Generic input and output\n* Closures for starting and cancelling work, handling results\n* Closures for evaluating preconditions\n* Making an AsyncOp dependent on input from another\n\nYou can subclass AsyncOp, but because it provides built-in storage for generic input and output and allows you to customize behavior with closures, in many if not most cases you can just use AsyncOp as-is.",
