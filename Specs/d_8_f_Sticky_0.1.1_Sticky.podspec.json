  "description": "Sticky allows developers to quickly and easily persist common Swift objects\nwithout the overhead of a full persistence layer. Sticky leverages JSON\nand the \"Document\" directory, along with the Codable protocol, for easy \nstorage and access. Sticky is not intended for extremely large or highly \ntransactional data sets, however, it does leverage caching to help with performance.\nSticky includes powerful features like built in notification center integration\nfor transaction events. It also includes a simple schema change management solution\nas app data structure changes over the life of the app.",
