  "description": "PixelTest is a modern, Swift-only snapshot testing tool.\n\nSnapshot testing compares one of your views rendered into an image, to a previously recorded image, allowing for 0% difference or the test will fail.\n\nSnapshot tests are perfect for quickly checking complex layouts, while at the same time future proofing them against accidental changes.\n\nUnlike other snapshot testing options, PixelTest supports declaring which resolution to record your snapshots in, so it doesn't matter which simulator you run your snapshot tests on.\n\nAs an added bonus, PixelTest also clears up after itself. If you fix a failing test, the failure and diff images are automatically removed for you.",
