  "description": "So you declared a `lazy var` in Swift thinking it would behave like lazily instantiated variables in good ol' Objective-C. You thought you would set them to `nil` and they would reconstruct themselves later on when needed.\n\nYou poor thing.\n\n[They don't](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40847994).\n\nSo why not bring that awesomeness back to Swift in a very lightweight way?",
