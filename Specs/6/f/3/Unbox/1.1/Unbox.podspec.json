  "description": "Unbox is an easy to use Swift JSON decoder. Don't spend hours writing JSON decoding code - just unbox it instead!\n\nUnbox is lightweight, non-magical and doesn't require you to subclass, make your JSON conform to a specific schema or completely change the way you write model code. It can be used on any model with ease.",
