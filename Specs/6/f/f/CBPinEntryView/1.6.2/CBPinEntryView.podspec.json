  "summary": "A view for entering arbitrary length pins, codes or passwords written in Swift 4.2. Supports one time codes.",
  "description": "This view allows a user to enter a pin or code (for security/mobile verification etc) of any length. It allows deletion, continuation, secure entry, and allows you to get the entire entered code as a single String or Int without having to join Strings from multiple text fields. It's fast, looks nice (I think) and is customisable! Requires iOS 9+.",
