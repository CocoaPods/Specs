  "description": "SQReorderableStackView is a UIViewSubclass written in Swift 3 that add a long press gesture recognizer to each of its subviews. When triggered, the handler will create a snapshot of the pressed subview and transform its position in response to changes in the touches. The SQReorderableStackViewDelegate protocol can be implemented by a controller to allow finer control of which subviews can be picked up and moved, and to respond to changes to the subview order made by the user.",
