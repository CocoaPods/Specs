Installing this pod will automatically install Facebook-iOS-SDK is it's not incluced in the workspace.\n\n\n                    pod 'Appboy-iOS-SDK/AppboyKitWithoutFacebookSupport'\n\n\n                    Warning: Integrating both pods will cause the SDK to be integrated twice which will cause errors!\n",
