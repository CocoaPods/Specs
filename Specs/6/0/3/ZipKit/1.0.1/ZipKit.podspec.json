  "description": "ZipKit is an Objective-C framework for reading and writing Zip archives in Mac OS X and iOS apps. It supports the standard PKZip format, files larger than 4GB in size using PKZip's zip64 extensions, optionally, resource forks in a manner compatible with Mac OS X's Archive Utility (in the Mac OS X targets only), and clean interruption so archiving can be cancelled by the invoking object (e.g., a NSOperation or NSThread).",
