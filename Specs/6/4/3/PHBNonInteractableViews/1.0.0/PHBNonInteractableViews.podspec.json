  "description": "We can use isUserInteractionEnabled to allow touches on a view to pass through to its parent.\nHowever, this has the inadvertant side-effect of disabling touches for all children of that view.\nIf we need our view to pass touches on itself through to its parent, while still allowing touches on its children to be registered by the children,\nthe correct solution is to subclass our view and override hitTest.\nThis library provides such subclasses of common UIView-types.",
