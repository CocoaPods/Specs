  "summary": "A calendar UI library that somewhat mimics a stripped down version of the default calendar app experience.",
  "description": "SSCalendar is a UI library that can be used to display a calendar of events within your app. This calendar library was originally built in 2013 for a project that required a calendar experience similar to the revamped Apple calendar app introduced in iOS 7. At the time, I found very few comprehensive calendar libraries and as a result decided to build one. SSCalendar provides 3 different calendar views - an annual view, monthly view and weekly/daily view. Note that this calendar is not designed as a picker but rather to display an existing set of events.",
