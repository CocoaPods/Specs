  "description": "If you are not familiarized with NSFetchedResultsController, it allows you to efficiently manage the results returned from a Core Data fetch request to provide data for a UITableView or a UICollectionView. NSFetchedResultsController monitors changes in Core Data objects and notifies the view about those changes allowing you to be reactive about them.\n\nUsing NSFetchedResultsController and NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate is awesome, but sadly it involves a lot of boilerplate. Well, luckily with DATASource not anymore.\n\n- Encapsulates NSFetchedResultsController and NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate boilerplate\n- Supports indexed tables out of the box\n- Supports sectioned collections out of the box\n- Swift\n- Objective-C compatibility",
