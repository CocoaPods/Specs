  "description": "AsyncImageCache is a fast cache implementation that stores UIImage instances in both memory and on disk. All operations are asynchronously executed on a background thread for maximum performance. The features are rather low level on purpose, this allows AsyncImageCache to be used as a basis for higher level implementations.",
