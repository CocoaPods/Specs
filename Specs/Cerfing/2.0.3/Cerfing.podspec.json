  "summary": "Lightweight json-based network protocol for rapid prototyping",
  "description": "I like constructing simple network protocols from plist/json-safe dictionaries, and transmit them over a socket as json, with as little framing as possible. Easy to prototype with, easy to debug. Give Cerfing an AsyncSocket, and it:\n\n* Will wrap the socket to send JSON-serialized dictionaries over it\n* Has a simple request-response system\n* Supports Arbitrary NSData attachments\n* Has an automatic 'delegate dispatching' feature, where the correct ObjC method is called based on the contents of the incoming method (very simplistic RPC)\n\nIt can also:\n\n* Support other serializations than JSON;\n* Be interleaved with another network protocol\n* Wrap other socket libraries than AsyncSocket using a 'transport' abstraction.",
