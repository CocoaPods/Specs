This version is updated for Protobuf 2.5.\n\n                        Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet extensible format.\n                        This project is based on an implementation of Protocol Buffers from Google.\n                        See the Google protobuf project for more information.\n",
