  "description": "                  The Courage iOS client is designed to received realtime events from\n                  a Courage service endpoint.\n\n                  The Courage service was invented to fulfill a specific niche in realtime\n                  delivery. Whereas other systems promise only best-effort delivery for\n                  actively connected clients, Courage:\n\n                  - Guarantees eventual delivery of all messages\n                  - Supports server-to-many-device event channels\n                  - Is a generalized interface to Android, iOS and Web clients\n                  - Has a fallback for actively connected devices to use the APNS\n                    silent sync feature\n                  - Will attempt to reconnect if the active connection is lost\n\n                  Limitations:\n\n                  - In-order delivery is impossible, and cannot be guaranteed\n                  - Message size limit of 1kB\n\n                  This client library must be used with the Courage service.\n",
