  "description": "You can develop several similar apps in one project by dividing them\nby different targets. With this library you can vary texts by tagging them like this: `NSLocalizedString(@\"LOGIN_INVITATION#APP1\", @\"\")` and `NSLocalizedString(@\"LOGIN_INVITATION#APP2\", @\"\")`. Works even for localized storyboard strings.",
