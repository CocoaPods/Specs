  "summary": "An extremely lightweight solution to dispatching status bar notifications from anywhere in your iOS application.",
  "description": "HBStatusBarNotification provides a simple one-liner for dispatching a text-based notification that will overlay the status bar for a short duration. It offers a range of customization options so that you can make the notification appear however you would like it to.\n\n    I made this because it's something a lot of iOS developers want in their application, but I found a lot of the existing options require more code and offer less customization. I wanted a solution that looked like it came from the same developer and wasn't obviously a library that I had dragged into my project.",
