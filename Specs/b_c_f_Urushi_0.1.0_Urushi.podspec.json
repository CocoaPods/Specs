  "description": "Urushi lets you use a `Glossy` struct as a persistent store.  Your struct is JSON serialized and persisted in `UserDefaults.shared`.  Setting values in your struct will update what is stored in `UserDefaults.shared`.  Put a static instance in your `AppDelegate` or something like that.  Then just set it (the `model`) and forget it!",
