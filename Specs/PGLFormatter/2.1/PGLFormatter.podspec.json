  "description": "# PGLFormatter\nPGLFormatter is a simple container of NSFormatter and useful functions  \n##Reason\nFormatters are extremely expensive to create so it's very important to reuse the formatter as much as you can. \n\nIf you use the same formatter in the entire project you can set in a single point (e.g. AppDelegate) and then forget about the NSFormatter and simple use the function that PGLFormatter offers, for format() to format Double Float Int (see the example), otherwise you should remember to set the behavior every time",
