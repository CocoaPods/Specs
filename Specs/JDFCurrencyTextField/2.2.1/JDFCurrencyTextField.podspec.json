  "description": "JDFCurrencyTextField is a drop-in replacement for UITextField to make it easier to work with monetary values. JDFCurrencyTextField makes it easier to enter monetary values because it formats the cell's text as a numeric string while the user is editing it, and formats it back to a currency string when they have finished. It defaults to using the currentLocale for the formatting, but this can be changed if necessary.",
