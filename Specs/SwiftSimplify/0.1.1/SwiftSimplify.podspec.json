  "summary": "Tiny high-performance Swift polyline simplification library",
  "description": "SwiftSimplify is a tiny high-performance Swift polyline simplification ported from Simplify.js.\nIt uses a combination of Douglas-Peucker and Radial Distance algorithms. It uses generics, works with Swift 1.2.\nPolyline simplification dramatically reduces the number of points in a polyline while retaining its shape, giving \na huge performance boost when processing it and also reducing visual noise. For example, it's essential when \t\nrendering a 70k-points line chart or a map route in the browser using Canvas or SVG.",
