  "description": "API is a wrapper for the AFNetworking framework by AlamoFire. This wrapper makes it easier to make a clean GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API requests without having to worry about setting up the methods every time. This library started off as a means for me to be able to initialize my API on my applications quicker, and I look forward to adding functionality to make it extra helpful to others.",
