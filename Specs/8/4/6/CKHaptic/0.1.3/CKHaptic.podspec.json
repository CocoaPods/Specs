  "description": "Play your custom haptic feedback with ease. With a few strings, you can create various mixes of haptic vibration. This SDK provides two types of haptics - Buzz and Beat, which you can customize with the variables such as intensity and sharpness. Under the hood it uses native Core Haptics library. The Buzz corresponds to 'hapticContinuous' and Beat to 'hapticTransient'. The intensity and sharpness are the same as in Core Haptics.",
