  "description": "ZoomWrapperSDK uses FaceTec that makes Certified Liveness Detection and 3D Face Matching fast, easy, and incredibly secure for everyone, regardless of their device.  During onboarding, FaceTec’s two-second video-selfie verifies Liveness, matches the user’s 3D FaceMap to their Photo ID, and sets up their new account.  Every time they return, FaceTec’s ongoing authentication again proves Liveness and compares their new 3D FaceMap to the one enrolled.  If they match they get instant access, no password required!",
