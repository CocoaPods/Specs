  "summary": "An easy-to-use animation library, inspired by JHChainableAnimations.",
  "description": "JHChainableAnimations is good, BUT, due to its unique syntax, the code could look very messy, if not undecipherable.\n\nKRAnimationKit adopts a more familiar and traditional syntax, making it really obvious what the functions will do.\nNot only that, it's really simple to mix and match animations for different views as well as reverse or repeat your animations.",
