  "summary": "Generates time-ordered identifiers as positive 64-bit integers without synchronization.",
  "description": "A Swift micro-framework for generating compact identifiers that are time ordered without the need for synchronization. Unlike UUID-based methods, the identifiers would only be 63-bits long — hence fit as a positive number in a 64-bit integer. These identifiers are also roughly time-ordered, hence can be used as a sorting attribute to get the corresponding data objects sorted by time as well.\nInspired from Twitter Snowflake identifier-creation algorithm.",
