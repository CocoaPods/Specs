  "description": "RCProxy will log all your HTTP requests inapp, with an expand / collapse JSON UI that will make debug even more easy. No more external proxy needed, you can implement it with only two lines of code. You will also be able to share curl requests and json responses easily. Your requests can be stored in a long-life database (for logging background requests for example), or just for a user session.",
