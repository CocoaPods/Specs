  "description": "Decomposed allows for CATransform3D, matrix_double4x4, and matrix_float4x4, to be decomposed, recomposed, and mutated without complex math.\nDecomposition is the act of breaking something down into smaller components, in this case transformation matrices into things like translation, scale, etc. in a way that they can all be individually changed or reset. The following are supported: Translation, Scale, Rotation, Skew, and Perspective.",
