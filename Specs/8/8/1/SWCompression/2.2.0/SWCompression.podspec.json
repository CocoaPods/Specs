  "description": "A framework which contains native (written in Swift) implementations of compression algorithms.\nSwift developers currently have access only to various wrappers written in Objective-C\naround system libraries if they want to decompress something. SWCompression allows to do this with pure Swift\nwithout relying on availability of system libraries.",
