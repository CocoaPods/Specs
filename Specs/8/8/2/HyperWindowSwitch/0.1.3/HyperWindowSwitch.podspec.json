  "description": "In some scenarios you have to change the UIWindow’s rootviewController such as when the user’s token is invalidated on the server and you have to show another viewController, e.g. a login viewController. Although you can deal with pushing or presenting the viewController but using HyperWindowSwitch brings such benefits:\n\nAllows to other viewControllers to be released (which preserves memory)\nProvides several predefined animations\nSupports custom animation.",
