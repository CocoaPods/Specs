  "description": "'NetworkLayer is a Swift networking library that simplifies making API requests and handling responses. It includes a singleton NetworkManager for global use, and an APIHandler class for managing network calls with Combine. The library supports reactive programming with Swift’s Combine framework, and provides clear, custom error handling through a NetworkError enum. It ensures easy-to-manage networking, clean data decoding, and error mapping, making it ideal for Swift applications that require robust network communication.'",
