  "description": "OCMockito is an Objective-C implementation of Mockito, supporting creation, \nverification and stubbing of mock objects.\n\nKey differences from other mocking frameworks:\n\n* Mock objects are always \"nice,\" recording their calls instead of \n  throwing exceptions about unspecified invocations. This makes tests less fragile.\n* No expect-run-verify, making tests more readable. Mock objects \n  record their calls, then you verify the methods you want.\n* Verification failures are reported as unit test failures, \n  identifying specific lines instead of throwing exceptions. This makes \n  it easier to identify failures.",
