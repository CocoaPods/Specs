  "description": "Rhino is Picovoice's Speech-to-Intent engine. It directly infers intent from spoken commands within a given context of\ninterest, in real-time. For example, given a spoken command *\"Can I have a small double-shot espresso?\"*, Rhino infers that the user wants to order a drink and emits the following inference result:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"espresso\",\n  \"size\": \"small\",\n  \"numberOfShots\": \"2\"\n}\n```\n\nRhino is:    \n    * using deep neural networks trained in real-world environments.\n    * compact and computationally-efficient, making it perfect for IoT.\n    * self-service. Developers and designers can train custom models using [Picovoice Console](https://picovoice.ai/console/).",
