  "description": "CoreDragon is a drag'n'drop library for iOS applications.\nInstead of using context menus, modal view controllers, share sheets\nand other \"indirect manipulation\" ways of moving data around, it's\nmuch more intuitive to just grab the thing you want to move, and drop\nit on the place where you want to move it to.\n\nCoreDragon uses similar concepts as the drag'n' drop APIs on MacOS,\nand modifies them to work better in a world with view controllers.\nIt works within a single application, and on modern iPads, between\napplications that are running in split screen mode.",
