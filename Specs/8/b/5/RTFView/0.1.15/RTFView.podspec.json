  "summary": "Custom view transforming text with formatting tags into a view tree",
  "description": "This custom view has three parts: parser, component(s) and the view itself. The Parser\nconverts the formatted text into a list of tokens each containing a list of tags and the text\nitself. The component converts a list of consecutive tokens, which all have\nthe same \"main\" tag, into a view representing the formatting. They also can be combined. The view\nitself wraps up these two components into a process of clearing the view tree, getting the new\ntoken list from the parser and passing it to the root component.",
