  "description": "CoreMIDI is complex and arguably convoluted, especially for the \nrequirements of most iOS apps. This library simplifies the semantics\nand brings it under a clear object model.\n\nNOTE, while this library is being used in production, it's still very\nbeta and not entirely feature complete (eg. MIDI Receive has not been implemented)\n\nProps to PGMidi, the Guru of nearly all of us CoreMIDI hackers",
