Works in both simulator and device.\nSupposed to be used when creating screenshots\nfor App Store - to have nice localized carrier info, time and other status bar information based on your needs.\n\nWe recommend to create different target for creating screenshots, where you will include this POD. Don't forgot to\nremove this package from production build! It is using private API, so that it will not pass App Store review (it also\ndoesn't have sense to be included in production builds)/",
