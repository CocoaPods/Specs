You can read more about the Feed Media API at [http://feed.fm/][1]. The primary object you will use to access the Feed Media API is the `FMAudioPlayer` singleton, which uses `AVFoundation` for audio playback.\n\n                    This quickstart guide assumes you will be using a single placement and the static library distribution of the Feed Media SDK, but the full source is available on Github at [https://github.com/fuzz-radio/iOS-SDK][2]. \n\n                    Before you begin, you should have an account at feed.fm and set up at least one *placement* and *station*. If you have not already done so, please go to [http://feed.fm/][3]. \n\n\n                    Resources\n                    =========\n\n                    For more information, please contact `support@fuzz.com` or check out our Github repo at [https://github.com/fuzz-radio/iOS-SDK][2].\n\n                    [1]: http://feed.fm/documentation\n                    [2]: https://github.com/fuzz-radio/iOS-SDK\n                    [3]: http://feed.fm/dashboard\n                    [4]: http://feed.fm/\n",
