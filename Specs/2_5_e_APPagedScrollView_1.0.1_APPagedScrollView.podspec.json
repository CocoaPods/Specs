With APPagedScrollView and it's UITableView-like API with delegates and data sources, you can get off your feet with barely any code.\n\nIn addition, there is an APPagedScrollViewController that can set up the scroll view for it, which implments the delegate and data source methods so that you can easily override those and provide the data you want.",
