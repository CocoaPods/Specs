  "description": "                   iOS 8 introduced `UIAlertController`, an abstraction above and replacement\n                   for `UIAlertView`. `UIAlertController` uses `UIAlertAction` instances\n                   to represent buttons (and actions for those buttons). But the interface\n                   doesn't lend itself to naturally fit in the ReactiveCocoa world\n\n                   Instead, we need to subclass it to ensure that certain things are set\n                   at initialization time. That's what this library does.\n",
