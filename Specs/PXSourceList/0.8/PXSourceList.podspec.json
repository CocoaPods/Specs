  "description": "                    Source Lists are used in a lot of Mac OS X applications, but the support for such controls is quite primitive – at best you create an Outline View with Source List highlighting, but none of the features such as badging are built in by default.\n                    PXSourceList is a reusable control – within the context of Source Lists – which makes creating applications with Source Lists a much easier process.\n",
