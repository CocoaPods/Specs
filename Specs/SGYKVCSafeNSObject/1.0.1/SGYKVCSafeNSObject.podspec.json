  "summary": "A category on NSObject that converts key value coding exceptions to NSError objects.",
  "description": "Provides a safe way to use key value coding on NSObject.  Since Swift does not support ObjC's @try command it cannot catch the exceptions thrown using key value coding (eg. setValue:forKey).  This library provides an extension on NSObject that will catch these exceptions and report them via NSError so that they can be safely used in Swift.",
