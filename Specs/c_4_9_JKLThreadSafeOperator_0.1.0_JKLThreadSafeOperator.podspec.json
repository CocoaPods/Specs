  "description": "Make a class thread-safe could be painful, as involving wrapping all your public methods into GCD operations.  \n\nThis operator is designated to perform thread-safe operations by simply wrapping read & write operations into corresponding blocks. So without changing original model classes, the project could benefit from multi-threading without compromising the stability.\n",
