  "description": "So what is this library useful for? Good question. Let's answer by asking an other question. Have you been struggled at some point by the following issues? :\n\n- Well, I need to add some shortcuts to some parts of my apps and it seems crappy to manually allocate the path and select the controllers I need.\n- I'm tired of using the push view controller method.\n- I wish I had some kind of url handling to get to specific parts of my app juste as easily as snapping a finger.\n- If it could even handle a controller stack this would juste be awesome.\n- I found a library but it's not working with my custom container...\n- I found a great library but the route matching is not working with my requirements...\n\nAll this points are answered by `WAAppRouting` (and more)",
