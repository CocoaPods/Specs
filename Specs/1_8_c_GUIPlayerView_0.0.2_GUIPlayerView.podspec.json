  "description": "                    GUIPlayerView implements a simple video player using AVPlayer.\n\n                    To use it, you must create a GUIPlayerView object and add it as a subview to your desired view.\n                    Then set the property `videoURL` and call `prepareAndPlayAutomatically:`.\n\n                    If you decide not to play automatically, you can leave for the user to press Play, or you can do it programmatically by calling `play`.\n\n                    Once you're done playing the video, you may want to remove it from your view. To do so, just call the method `clean` and everything will be released, and the player view will be removed from its superview.\n\n                    There are several optional delegate methods you can use:\n\n                    * `- (void)playerDidPause;`\n                    * `- (void)playerDidResume;`\n                    * `- (void)playerDidEndPlaying;`\n                    * `- (void)playerWillEnterFullscreen;`\n                    * `- (void)playerDidEnterFullscreen;`\n                    * `- (void)playerWillLeaveFullscreen;`\n                    * `- (void)playerDidLeaveFullscreen;`\n                    * `- (void)playerFailedToPlayToEnd;`\n                    * `- (void)playerStalled;`\n"
