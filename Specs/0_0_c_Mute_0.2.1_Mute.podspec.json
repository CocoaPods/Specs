  "description": "There is no native iOS API to detect if the mute switch is enabled/disabled on a device.\n\nThe general principle to check if the device is muted is to play a short sound and detect the length it took to play.\nFrom this length we can determine if it was muted or not.\n\nThis library is a Swift variant of https://github.com/moshegottlieb/SoundSwitch.",
