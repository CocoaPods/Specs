  "description": "This library solves the problem of having to maintain Apple's UI Tests, but lets you automate UI Tests for\nintegration testing.  By using this library, you are no longer subject to the limitations of the UI Tests\nthat Apple provides a framework for.  You can run UI Tests as part of a normal Unit Test target.  The strategy\nis similar to many other language UI Testing frameworks, timers and conditional checks.  See the example project\nto see how it starts you off.\n\nI wrote this library, because it's the basic building blocks that I've used in so many iOS projects now.\nI've had issues with the Apple UI Test framework and it's time to apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\nprinciple.",
