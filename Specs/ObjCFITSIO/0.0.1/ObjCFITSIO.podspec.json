  "description": "                   ObjCFITSIO has been started in support of the development of an OSX app called \"Stif\" which is intended to be a kind of iTunes-for-FITS files.\n                   It is voluntarily asynchronous by design (since operations on large images can be long), and use Grand Central Dispatch to achieve so.\n                   Ultimately, I would like to see it supporting most of the APIs of cfitsio. But at start, it is developed along the Stif app.\n",
