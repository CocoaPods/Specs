  "description": "GAJavaScript is a Cocoa Touch library that makes working with JavaScript easier from native code. It has a couple of important design goals:\n1. Make working with JavaScript objects and functions more like working with Objective-C objects and methods.\n2. Allow native applications on iOS devices to take advantage of JavaScript to support sharing code across platforms or making applications more dynamic.\n3. Let native iOS developers take advantage of some of the great web technologies inside WebKit.",
