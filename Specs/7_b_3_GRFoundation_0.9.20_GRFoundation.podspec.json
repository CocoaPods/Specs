  "description": "This collects a number of categories that flesh-out the Foundation and UIKit frameworks with some much-needed\nfunctionality. Includes a number of image manipulation and creation routines, as well as some helpers for\nextracting useful data about a iOS device. It also includes a lightweight Observable class (along the lines of a Rx Observable) and\na lightweight POCO (Plain Old Cocoa Object) to NSDictionary mapper, which makes it easy to turn your Objective-C objects into dictionaries\nsuitable for JSON serialization.  Throw in some date utilties and a class for constructing URL query strings, and that is GRFoundation!",
