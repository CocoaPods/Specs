  "description": "                   M13AsynchronousImageView is a category extension of UIImageView that loads images asynchronously. Just pass the URL of the image, local or external, and the UIImageView will take care of loading the image in the background. This is perfect for UITableViews and UICollectionViews, as it doesn't block the main thread with image loading, so the main interface is still responsive.\n",
