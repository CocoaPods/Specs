  "description": "SimpleRoundedButton is a UIButton subclass that uses @IBInspectable attributes to allow easy customization of border properties, colors and corner radius, directly from the Storyboard. The corner radius is automatically constrained to half the button height or width. To achieve completely rounded sides, just set the value to something like 100. For instant preview, it also supports @IBDesignable.",
