  "description": "Shark is an open source ORM, designed from the start to be low maintenance and natural to use, developers choose shark for its power and simplicity.\n\nWith just a couple of lines of code getting you started, it is faster to get started than any other database system.\n\nReal class objects are used and extended, with a simple persistence model and the datastore is always refactored to your class structures, with no effort from the developer.\n\nObjects are retrieved using a FLUENT interface, but the same methods give you COUNT, SUM, GROUP & DISTINCT.\n\nYour object model is tuneable with indexes and query optimisations and it is entirely thread-safe in every situation, in fact, you don't have to worry about it at all.",
