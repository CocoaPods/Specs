  "description": "MAChineLearning is framework that provides a quick and easy way to experiment Machine Learning with\nnative code on the Mac, with some specific support for Natural Language Processing. It is written in Objective-C, but it is\ncompatible by Swift.\n\nCurrently the framework supports:\n\n* Neural Networks\n* Bag of Words\n* Word Vectors\n\nDifferently than many other machine learning libraries for macOS and iOS, MAChineLearning includes full training implementation\nfor its neural networks. You don't need a separate language or another framework to train the network, you have all you need here.",
