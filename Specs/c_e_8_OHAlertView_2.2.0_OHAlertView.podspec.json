  "description": "UIAlertView subclass that uses blocks to handle the code to execute after the user tapped a button.\n\nNo need to implement a delegate method anymore,\nand this makes it much more easier to manage especially when you use multiple AlertView in the same class.\n\nThis class also allows you to handle AlertViews with a timeout\n(it simulates a tap on the button you specify after a given number of seconds)",
