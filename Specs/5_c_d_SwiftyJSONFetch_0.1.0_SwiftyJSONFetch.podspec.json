  "summary": "A lightweight JSON fetching library.",
  "description": "Due to the amount of coding challenges for new jobs, where 99% are about loading JSON from somewhere, I decided to implement my own solution instead of using Alamofire (which is indeed awesome) or another library. That helped me refreshing my knowledge and in the end I learned something new. I also decided to make it public so you guys can learn or even make it better. Feel free to contribute! Bring in your ideas!",
