  "description": "Smart Credentials is a library with multiple generic functionalities. The focus is on having components that are not application-specific, so that they can be easily integrated into multiple applications.\nThe main feature of the library is the secure storage. The library itself is data type – agnostic and can handle both sensitive and plain user data. Based on the data definition, the library has internal mechanisms to retrieve/store content or manipulate data pieces.\nOther features include QR-based login, barcode reader, OCR reader/parser, OTP generator, fingerprint/pin/pattern/faceId authorization.",
