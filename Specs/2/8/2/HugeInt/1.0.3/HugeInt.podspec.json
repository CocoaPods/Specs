  "description": "A simple, pure swift library to help handling of huge int values (usually in incremental games). Upper limit is only the memory of the device. Value displaying: 1 = 1, 1000 = 1a, 1000000 = 1b, etc... Supported operations: +, -, *, /, %, <<, >>. (Shifting shifts x digits which means multiplying or dividing by 1000Ë†x, eg: 1a << 1 = 1b))",
