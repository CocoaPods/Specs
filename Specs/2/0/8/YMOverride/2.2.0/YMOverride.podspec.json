  "description": "Override helps minimize the boilerplate involved with adding and maintaining feature flags.\nTypically app developers employ feature flags to manage access to feature which are still in\ndevelopment, experimental, or behind an A/B test.\n\nFeature flags typically have 3 states: on, off, or defaulted. The default state of a feature\nmay be a preset mode or defined by a remote configuration or A/B testing system. Override\nsupports these use cases.",
