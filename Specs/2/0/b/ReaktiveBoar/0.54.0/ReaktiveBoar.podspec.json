  "description": "Bond is a Swift reactive binding framework that takes binding concept to a whole new level.\nIt's simple, powerful, type-safe and multi-paradigm - just like Swift.\n\nBond is also a framework that bridges the gap between the reactive and imperative paradigms.\nYou can use it as a standalone framework to simplify your state changes with bindings and reactive data sources,\nbut you can also use it with ReactiveKit to complement your reactive data flows with bindings and\nreactive delegates and data sources.",
