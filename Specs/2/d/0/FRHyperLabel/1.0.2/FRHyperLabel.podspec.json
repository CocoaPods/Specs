With FRHyperLabel, You can define different style, handler and highlight appearance for difference hyperlinks in a super-easy way.\n\n\n* Think: Why did you write this? What is the focus? What does it do?\n* CocoaPods will be using this to generate tags, and improve search results.\n* Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.\n* Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!",
