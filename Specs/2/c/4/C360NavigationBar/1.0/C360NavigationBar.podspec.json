  "description": "                   C360NavigationBar is a subclass of UINavigationBar with a solid appearance.  It has two advantages over a stock opaque UINavigationBar:\n\n                   1. It sets its bar colour based on your window's tintColor, and will dim when your window is dimmed (e.g. by an alert view or action sheet)\n\n                   2. You can set a separate tintColor for your bar items, allowing the user to tell which elements are tappable.\n",
