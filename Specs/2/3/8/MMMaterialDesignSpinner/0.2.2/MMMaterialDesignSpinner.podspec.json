  "description": "I love Google's new indeterminate spinner in the [Material Design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/progress-activity.html#progress-activity-types-of-indicators), and I hadn't found a recreation of it for iOS yet, so I created it using CoreGraphics and CoreAnimation, which makes it super lightweight, smooth, and scalable to large sizes.\n\nSpecial thanks to the following projects and articles that helped me create this:\n* [Google Material Design's Animated Loading Spinner Using HTML, CSS and SVG](http://david.ingledow.co.uk/blog/google-material-designs-animated-loading-spinner-svg-and-css/) for help figuring out exactly what animations were going on.\n* [LLARingSpinnerView](https://github.com/lipka/LLARingSpinnerView) as the base for a custom activity spinner UIView.\n* [center-vfl](https://github.com/evgenyneu/center-vfl) because centering things with Auto Layout's VFL is way harder than it should be to remember.\n* [kylefox / color.m gist](https://gist.github.com/kylefox/1689973) for creating random UIColor values.",
