  "summary": "Separate the analytics from your main business logic.",
  "description": "Anna is an analytics abstraction library which helps separate the analyzing part of code from the main business logic. Although inspired by AOP, Anna doesn't require method-swizzling, which consumes considerable runtime. Instead, it needs a tiny piece of code to be inserted into the analyzed method. And then all the magic starts.",
