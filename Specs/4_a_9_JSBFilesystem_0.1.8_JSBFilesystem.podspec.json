  "description": "JSBFilesystem are lightweight classes that clean up the syntax with accessing the filesystem. Every read and write call is coordinated with `NSFileCoordinator`. `NSFilePresenter` is used by `JSBObservedDirectory` to get notifications when anything in that directory changes. The changes are detected whether they come from in or out of your process. IGListKit is then used to create a Diff between the old contents and the new contents. If changes are detected a closure/block is called so your code can update its UI.",
