  "description": "  Pajdeg is a self-contained library for mutating PDFs. \n  \n  It's built around the principles of a pipe, where the original PDF is examined, needed changes are determined and tasks are \"attached\" based on page number, object ID, etc. and then simply sent through a pipe into a new PDF with the desired modifications. \n  \n  This is the Objective-C wrapper for Pajdeg, which includes a number of improvements over the C core library.\n",
