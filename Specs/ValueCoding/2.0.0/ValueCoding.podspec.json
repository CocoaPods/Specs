  "description": "ValueCoding is a simple pair of protocols to support the archiving \nand unarchiving of Swift value types.\n\nIt works by allowing a value type, which must conform to ValueCoding \nto define via a typealias its archiver. The archiver is another type \nwhich implements the ArchiverType protocol. This type will typically \nbe an NSObject which implements NSCoding and is an adaptor which is \nresponsible for encoding and decoding the properties of the value.",
