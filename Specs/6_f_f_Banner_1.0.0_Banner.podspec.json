  "description": "When you want to display a message to a user but don't want to display a popup that the user has to dismiss, Banner comes in handy by creating a small, non-intrusive alert view in the corners of a UIViewController. Now, instead of taking up the entire screen with a dialog, just use Banner to display a UIView in either the top left, top right, bottom left, or bottom right corner of an iOS screen.",
