  "summary": "Add the missing network activity indicator on iPhone X",
  "description": "iPhone X, XS, and XR don't display the network activity indicator anymore. This pod\nbrings it back by placing an activity indicator in the upper left of the screen on \ntop of the regular status bar items. Since a circular indicator wouldn't fit, a \nrectangular \"KITT scanner\" like indicator with a gradient is shown. The indicator UI \ncan be used standalone or as a \"fix\" for the iOS network activity indicator (using \nthe existing API).",
