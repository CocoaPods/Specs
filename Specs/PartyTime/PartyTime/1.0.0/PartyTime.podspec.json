  "description": "                   This is a light wrapper around the MultiPeer connectivity framework which quickly connects devices without having to send or receive invites. Here's the quick setup:\n\n Each device calls:\n \n    PLPartyTime *partyTime = [[PLPartyTime alloc] initWithServiceType@\"MyApp\"];\n    partyTime.delegate = self;\n    [partyTime joinParty];\n\n Each device will get a callback when anyone connects or disconnects. Note that any device which joins the party with this service type will automatically join without sending or receiving invitations.\n\n    - (void)partyTime:(PLPartyTime *)partyTime peer:(MCPeerID *)peer changedState:(MCSessionState)state currentPeers:(NSArray *)currentPeers;\n \n Then, anytime you want to send data, you can call a method to send to all connected users (peers) or an array of select peers.\n\n    - (BOOL)sendData:(NSData *)data withMode:(MCSessionSendDataMode)mode error:(NSError **)error;\n    - (BOOL)sendData:(NSData *)data toPeers:(NSArray *)peerIDs withMode:(MCSessionSendDataMode)mode error:(NSError **)error;\n\n The clients receiving data get the callback:\n\n    - (void)partyTime:(PLPartyTime *)partyTime didReceiveData:(NSData *)data fromPeer:(MCPeerID *)peerID;\n\n And that's it.\n There are a few more features of this library, but I'll let you read through the documentation to find those specifically. \n",
