  "description": "Apple's JSONSerialization framework is very basic. It works well and everything, but being able to dive into a JSON structure, once parsed, can be quite a pain. Using a similar paradigm as what C# uses with Newtonsoft's JSON parser, this framework allows you to pass in a string as a path in a <key>.<subkey>[index] format and let the framework do the job. Now, you can even pass in a pre-parsed dictionary and have JSONParser navigate through it using the JSONPath object.",
