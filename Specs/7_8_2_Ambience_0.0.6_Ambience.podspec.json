  "description": "Ambience, a brightness aware ambient lightning accessibility framework. Although Apple has yet to publicize the APIs for the ambient light sensor, it does let a given app look for screen brightness events. And thatâ€™s exactly what Ambience does. It listens to events and relays state thresholds to your app so it can adapt its looks and layout.",
