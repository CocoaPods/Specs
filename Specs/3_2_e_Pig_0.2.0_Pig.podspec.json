  "description": "                   Developing for multiple mobile platforms is both time-consuming and expensive. Writing completely separate\n                   versions in Java and Objective-C in parallel duplicates logic and wastes effort, especially when requirements\n                   change. Writing an application using PhoneGap generally leads to the UI to feeling non-standard and ultimately\n                   to a sub-par user experience.\n\n                   Pig aims to solves these problems by moving the business logic into a shared Javascript codebase. On each platform\n                   (currently Android and iOS), the user interface is implemented in native code, leading the best possible user\n                   experience, while data manipulation and other logic is handled by the shared Javascript.\n",
