  "summary": "nanomsg is a socket library that provides several common communication patterns. It aims to make the networking layer fast, scalable, and easy to use. Implemented in C, it works on a wide range of operating systems with no further dependencies.",
  "description": "The communication patterns, also called \"scalability protocols\", are basic blocks for building distributed systems. By combining them you can create a vast array of distributed applications. The following scalability protocols are currently available:\nPAIR - simple one-to-one communication,\nBUS - simple many-to-many communication\nREQREP - allows to build clusters of stateless services to process user requests\nPUBSUB - distributes messages to large sets of interested subscribers\nPIPELINE - aggregates messages from multiple sources and load balances them among many destinations\nSURVEY - allows to query state of multiple applications in a single go",
