  "summary": "An extension of the `CovertOps` pod which includes a compatible CoreData expansion pack.",
  "description": "The original `CovertOps` framework uses operations from Apple's Foundation framework for achieving precise timing, exclusivity, thread safety, asynchronous behavior and dependency management.  This add-on uses that architecture to create a thread-safe implementation of a CoreData stack that uses operations to read and write from a persistent store.",
