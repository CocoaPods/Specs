  "description": "Horizon SDK is a state of the art real-time video recording / photo shooting iOS library.\n\nSome of the features of Horizon SDK include:\n\nHorizon real-time leveling algorithm (you can find more at https://horizon.camera)\nSupport for multiple resolutions (up to 2K recording) and frame rates.\nCustom filter support using the Core Image framework.\nMultiple previews.\nA simple view controller that makes integrating the SDK to your app really easy.\nAccess to the video buffer so that it can be further processed or live streamed using other libraries.\nIn order to use Horizon SDK on your app, you have to receive an API key by contacting us. The provided sample apps contain their own API keys.\n\nThe library can be used on devices running iOS version 8 or higher. You can build your application using the latest Xcode.\n\nFor more information take a look at the Installation and Quick Start guides of the documentation.\n\n#leveling #filter #capture #video #photo",
