  "description": "Flapjack is an iOS/macOS/tvOS framework with 2 primary goals.\n\n1. Help you abstract your model-focused database persistence layer from the rest\n   of your app\n2. Simplify the database layer's API into an easy-to-use, easy-to-remember, full\n   Swift one\n\nIt lets you skip the boilerplate commonly associated with database layers like\nCore Data and lets you introduce structured, sane data persistence in your app\nsooner, letting you spend more of your time creating the app you really want. We\nuse it at O'Reilly Media and Safari Books Online for our iOS apps, and if you\nlike what you see, perhaps you will too.",
