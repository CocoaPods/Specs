  "description": "Particle Auth provides MPC (Multi-Party Computation)-based threshold signatures.\nWith threshold signatures, each party creates an independent key. They then forge the vault’s lock together in a modular way, in which each party shapes a part of the lock that corresponds to its key.\nOur security is unlike any other auth/wallet service: it's better. Complex passwords and long seed phrases, browser extensions, and special hardware are no longer required for log-in. Instead, accounts are secured by industry-leading TSS implementation and KMS encryption.",
