  "description": "    This is a set of categories for performing concurrent map and filter\n    operations on Foundation data structures, currently NSArray, NSDictionary,\n    NSSet.\n\n    Concurrency is achieved using Grand Central Dispatch's (GCD) dispatch_apply.\n    By default, operations are run on the default priority global concurrent\n    queue. The operations can be performed on any concurrent queue. This library\n    provides similar functionality to `pmap` as found in other languages.\n",
