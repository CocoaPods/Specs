  "description": "                       The `OpenInGoogleMapsController` class is designed to make it easy for an iOS\ndeveloper to open a map, show a Street View location, or show a set of directions directly in Google\nMaps. The class supports using the `x-callback-URL` standard so that you can add a \"Back to my app\"\nbutton directly within Google Maps, and supports a number of fallback strategies, so that you can\nautomatically open the map in another application if the user does not have Google Maps installed.\n",
