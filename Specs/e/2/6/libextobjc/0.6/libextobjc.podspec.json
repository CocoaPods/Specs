  "description": "                    The Extended Objective-C library extends the dynamism of the Objective-C programming language to support additional patterns present in other dynamic programming languages (including those that are not necessarily object-oriented).\n\n                    libextobjc is meant to be very modular â€“ most of its classes and modules can be used with no more than one or two dependencies.                    \n",
