  "description": "                       MVReport aims to solve reporting problem on iOS by introducing set of classes similar to Apple's iOS Printing API but for report generation. It uses the same paradigm, formatter and page renderer objects, and same methods where it make sense. But, It also extends functionality by adding some new objects that allow generation of repeatable content, and positioning of text sections relative to other sections.\n",
