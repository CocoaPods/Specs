  "description": "Apps are becoming more complex so why not make navigation 3d to help with building them. A navigation layer can be created anywhere even outside a UIViewController, creating a brand new navigation stack in a new window. The Navigation Layer is removed from memory as soon as you dismiss the first view controller. Create more complex navigation flows that are easier to control and dismiss with ease. Allow stacking of multiple Navigation Layers or play it safe by using the default settings, so you do not need to bother tracking your layers.",
