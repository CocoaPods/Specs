  "description": "The APS mobile monetization program is designed to integrate Amazon’s demand into your ad server and ad optimization stack. It works through two main components, an Amazon-provided SDK and the Key-Value targeting or Custom Targeting feature in your ad server.\nGeneral Process - \n1. The SDK needs to be included in your App. \n2. It calls Amazon to see if we have ads available to show on the page and sets a flag or a key for each ad that Amazon has available.  \n3. You also need to set up ad tags provided by Amazon in your ad server. \n4. When serving an ad, your ad server includes the Amazon tag ad as a candidate in its consideration set if the key value pair is set. \n5. It only serves the Amazon ad tag if it meets all of its own optimization criteria and if the key value pair is set.",
