  "description": "<<-DESC\n  JustLog brings logging on iOS to the next level. It supports console, file and remote Logstash logging via TCP socket out of the box. You can setup JustLog to use [logz.io](http://logz.io) with no effort. JustLog relies on SwiftyBeaver, exposes a simple swifty API but it plays just fine also with Objective-C.\n                         DESC",
