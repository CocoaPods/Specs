  "description": "Relayout is a Swift microframework to make using Auto Layout easier with static and dynamic layouts.\nInstead of trying to hold references to specific constraints and mutating them when your state\nchanges, create a single object that returns all the constraints you need for any given UI state.\nRelayout will apply those new constraints automatically as needed. This makes it super easy to create\nreally dynamic layouts that change or react to UI state changes using Auto Layout.",
