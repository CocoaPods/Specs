  "description": "                   NSObject+DHNObjectMapping maps the keys of the dictionary representation to the properties of the data \n                   object by using Key-Value Coding by default. If your data object has a property named equally to a key \n                   in the dictionary representation its value gets mapped to the property on the data object. You can change\n                   this default behavior. But in general you only need to handle special mapping for your objects.\n",
