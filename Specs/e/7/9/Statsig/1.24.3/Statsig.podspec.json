  "description": "Statsig enables developers to ship code faster and more safely by providing:\n- Feature gating so you can control precisely which subset of your users should see a feature,\n  and have complete control over a features' ON and OFF status remotely without code changes.\n- Dynamic Configs so you can change the values of your button colors, font sizes, labels and etc.\n  any time you want, for a subset of users or all of them.\n- Custom event logging so you can track how your critical metrics move with your product launches,\n  and also run A/B tests to understand whether a new feature actually helps your product before shipping.",
