  "homepage": "https://github.com/GreenJell0/Slingshot",
  "description": "This extension adds a \"slingshot\" behavior to any scroll view via `isSlingshotEnabled`. When enabled, if the user scrolls past the bottom of\nthe content a certain amount (the \"threshold\") and releases, the scroll view will slingshot and scroll back to the top of the content. As they scroll past\nthe content, a view (the slingshot view) appears and hints that this behavior is available and when they've scrolled sufficiently far. This behavior is\nimplemented by observing the scroll view's content offset and keying off of certain stateful properties (see `startObserving`) to determine whether the user\nis scrolling and whether the slingshot should engage and trigger.",
