  "description": "The Jabberwocky® Head Tracking Kit (JabberwockyHTKit) is an open-source iOS framework, developed by Swiftable LLC, that provides a touch-free interface for existing iOS applications. Jabberwocky enables users to interact with an application by just moving their head. Head movement translates into the movement of a mouse-like cursor on the screen. By default, blinks trigger a .touchUpInside event simulating a tap on any UIControl subclass (in fact any subclass of UIView can be extended to respond to a facial gesture trigger).",
