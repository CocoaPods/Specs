  "description": "                   Task is a simple framework for representing tasks — units of work that have prerequisites,\n                   dependencies, and can succeed or fail. The framework provides a straightforward way to \n                   create multiple tasks with blocks, selectors, etc.; create relationships between them; and\n                   then execute them all together so that tasks only start once all their prerequisite tasks\n                   finish successfully.\n",
