  "summary": "MultipartUpload is designed to simplify large file background upload for iOS",
  "description": "Multipart upload handles the complexity in cutting up large files, queuing and background uploading them for you.\n\nIt requires a sibling implementation on the server end to accept the multipart upload and stitch it together.\n\nFor example: https://github.com/Anamico/S3StreamThru\nWhich is a node express middleware that handles streaming the upload directly to an S3 bucket server side before the\ncompleted file URL on S3 is passed on to the express route as a completed upload for processing by the server.",
