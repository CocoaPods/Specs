The modifications made are designed to match the images you see on the Apple site and are as follows:\n\n                        * 9:41 AM is displayed for the time.\n                        * The battery is full and shows 100%.\n                        * On iPhone: The carrier text is removed, 5 bars of cellular signal and full WiFi bars are displayed.\n                        * On iPad: The carrier text is set to \"iPad\" and full WiFi bars are displayed.\n",
