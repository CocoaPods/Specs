  "description": "UIStackView allows developers to build auto-layout UIs without needing to set up constraints -- a powerful way of building layouts, which unfortunately requires a certain amount of boilerplate code. This framework exposes the convenience of that approach, but reduces the required boilerplate by wrapping it in a declarative syntax.",
