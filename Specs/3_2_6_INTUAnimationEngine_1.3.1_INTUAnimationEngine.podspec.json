  "description": "  INTUAnimationEngine makes it easy to build advanced custom animations on iOS.\n\n  INTUAnimationEngine provides a friendly interface to drive custom animations using a CADisplayLink, inspired by the UIView block-based animation API. It enables interactive animations (normally driven by user input, such as a pan or pinch gesture) to run automatically over a given duration. It can also be used to get a callback every frame of an animation.\n\n  INTUAnimationEngine includes an extensive library of easing functions that can be used to customize animation timing, as well as a complete library of interpolation functions to animate any type of value or property including those that are not animatable by Core Animation.\n \n  The project also includes a standalone spring physics library to simulate damped harmonic motion. This is used under the hood to power a spring animation API on INTUAnimationEngine that allows full control over the damping, stiffness, and mass parameters. Since the spring solver is a completely independent and generic library implemented in pure C, it can be used on its own for many other applications apart from animation.\n",
