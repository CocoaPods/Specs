  "description": "Shram - is easy to use but powerful framework for communication with RESTful web services via HTTP requests. Shram will help you to send a request to a server in just a few lines of code. The main advantage of this framework is clarity and easy of use. But this is not all the features of Shram. Shram supports mapping objects from the server response. Thus, you can easily query the server for any data and use it now as ready-made objects. But you don't need to build them by hand. Shram will do it for you.",
