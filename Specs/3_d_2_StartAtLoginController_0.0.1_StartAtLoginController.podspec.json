This is the required way to do login items for sandboxed applications\n  (required for all Mac App Store apps) and works in non-sandboxed applications\n  as well.\n\n  It's been tested on 10.7 and 10.8 (and should work on 10.6.6+). Entries set by\n  this class do not appear in the Accounts Panel of System Preferences.\n",
