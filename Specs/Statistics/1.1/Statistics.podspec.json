  "description": "    Statistics is a Foundation framework for calculating—no points for guessing\n    it—statistics. It is inspired by Perl's Statistics::Descriptive and like it\n    consists of two main classes.\n\n    SBStatistics calculates a range of statistical measurements on the fly as\n    each data point is added. The data is then immediately discarded, giving it\n    a very low memory footprint.\n\n    SBFullStatistics in turn subclasses SBStatistics and records each data\n    point. It is therefore able to provide more advanced statistical functions.\n    The trade-off is that it can consume a lot of memory if you are collecting a\n    lot of data.\n",
