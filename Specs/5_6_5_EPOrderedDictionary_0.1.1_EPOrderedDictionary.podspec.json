  "description": "It's known that the `NSDictionary` and `NSMutableDictionary` in Foundation framework are all unordered collections of key-value pairs, but in some real scenarios, we do need the data structure to hold the ordered key-value pairs. In order to fill this kind of gap, this library was born.",
