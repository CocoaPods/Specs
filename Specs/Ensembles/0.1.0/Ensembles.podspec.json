  "description": " \t\t   Ensembles extends Apple's Core Data framework to add \n                   peer-to-peer synchronization for Mac OS and iOS. \n                   Multiple SQLite persistent stores can be coupled together \n                   via a file synchronization platform like iCloud or Dropbox. \n                   The framework can be readily extended to support any \n                   service capable of moving files between devices, including \n                   custom servers.\n",
