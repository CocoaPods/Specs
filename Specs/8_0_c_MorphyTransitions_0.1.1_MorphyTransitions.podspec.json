Please see readme or instructions on how to use it.\n\nstep1: use TransNavController instead of UINavigationController\nstep2 (in storyboard): use \"morph id\" on the starting viewcontroller to name views that will transition to the ending viewcontroller and the cocoapod will take it from there\n\nstep2 (in code): use \"morphIdentifier\" on the starting viewcontroller to name views that will transition to the ending viewcontroller and the cocoapod will take it from there\n\nTo to use any animations, use <UIView>.overlapViewWithReset, <UIView>.swapViewsWithReset or <UIView>.swapView for animations",
