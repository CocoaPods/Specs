  "summary": "Compile-time safe Swift dependency injection framework with real code.",
  "description": "Needle is a dependency injection (DI) system for Swift. Unlike other DI frameworks, such as Cleanse, Swinject, Needle encourages hierarchical DI structure and utilizes code generation to ensure compile-time safety. This allows us to develop our apps and make changes with confidence. If it compiles, it works. In this aspect, Needle is more similar to Android Dagger.",
