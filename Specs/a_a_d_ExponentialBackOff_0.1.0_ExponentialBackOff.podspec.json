  "summary": "A framework which implements the ExponentialBackOff algorithm which is usefull for Networking.",
  "description": "This framework implements the ExponentialBackOff algorithm which you can use for Networking or other tasks which should be retried after some time without worrying about how long you have to wait for the next attempt.\nGoogle mentioned this algorithm to be used to request a GCM token. In Java they implemented this in their java api repository but for iOS and OSX developers this is the right framework.\nI tried to put more features into this pod than simple a lame algorithm without much more.\nFor example you just have to pass your code as a closure or by implementing a Protocol and passing the class to one of the methods. You don't have to worry about waiting the right amount of time or recalling your code, the Handler makes this automatically.\nYou also have the option to implement your own algorithm without worrying about how to handle the automatic reattempts.",
