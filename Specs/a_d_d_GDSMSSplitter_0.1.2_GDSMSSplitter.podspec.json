  "description": "The `GDSMSSplitter` class is responsible for actuall splitting. `GDSMSCounterLabel` is a `UILabel` subclass which implements the basic pattern for showing a user the number of SMS-messages potentially sent to recipient and the count of leftover symbols.\n\n`GDSMSSplitter` provides support for **GSM 03.38** standard (including **basic character set extension table**, but *excluding* **national language shift tables**). It also supports **UTF-16** (*UCS-2*) encoding standard.\n\n[Wikipedia article on GSM 03.38](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38)\n",
