  "description": "                   Accessing manga data online is relatively difficult without web scraping, which can prove to be unreliable. Luckily, MangaEden has an API that can be used (without needing authentication) to get access to its wealth of archived manga and manga chapters. Marimo is an Objective-C wrapper around the MangaEden API meant to abstract the API's details.\n",
