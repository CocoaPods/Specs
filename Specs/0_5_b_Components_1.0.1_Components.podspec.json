  "description": "Code organization components optimized for minimizing the coupling between separate functionalities in an iOS application.\n\nThe framework consists of three main and two supporting object types:\n\n- Router - Decides which module should be opened\n- Navigator - Allows for view hierarchy agnostic presentation of view controllers\n- Module - Fully encapsulates a specific piece of functionality\n- Builder - Instantiates modules and prepares them for use\n- Container - Contains and injects dependencies into other objects\n\nThe framework is designed for each separate component to be as generalized as possible. You are free to replace them with your own implementations, they just have to conform to the existing protocols.",
