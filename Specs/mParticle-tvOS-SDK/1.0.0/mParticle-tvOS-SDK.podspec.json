  "description": "Your job is to build an awesome app experience that consumers love. You also need several tools and services to make data-driven decisions.\nLike most app owners, you end up implementing and maintaining numerous SDKs ranging from analytics, attribution, push notification, remarketing, \nmonetization, etc. But embedding multiple 3rd party libraries creates a number of unintended consequences and hidden costs. From not being \nable to move as fast as you want, to bloating and destabilizing your app, to losing control and ownership of your 1st party data.\n\nmParticle solves all these problems with one lightweight SDK. Implement new partners without changing code or waiting for app store approval. \nImprove stability and security within your app. We enable our clients to spend more time innovating and less time integrating.",
