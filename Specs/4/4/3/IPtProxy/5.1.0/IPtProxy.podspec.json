  "description": "Lyrebird/Obfs4proxy as well as Snowflake and DNSTT Pluggable Transports are written in Go, which\nis a little annoying to use on iOS and Android.\nThis project encapsulates all the machinations to make it work and provides an\neasy-to-install binary including a wrapper around both.\n\nProblems solved in particular are:\n\n- One cannot compile `main` packages with `gomobile`. For all PTs, IPtProxy\n  provides wrapper code to use them as libraries.\n- All PTs are gathered under one roof here, since you cannot have two\n  `gomobile` frameworks as dependencies. There are some common Go\n  runtime functions exported, which would create a name clash.\n- Free ports to be used are automatically found by this library and can be fetched\n  by the consuming app after start.\n\nContained transport versions:\n\n| Transport | Version      |\n|-----------|--------------|\n| Lyrebird  | 0.8.1        |\n| Snowflake | 2.11.0       |\n| DNSTT     | 1.20240513.0 |",
