It is built on top of the [Foundation framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/objc_classic/_index.html) and it uses the high-level operation and networking abstractions built into the Cocoa framework. The design of this interface aims to be easy-to-use in your projects and semantically related to the API.\n",
