  "description": "When calling some API provided via Mashape, you can use the request example they provide. The problem is, that most developers are (at least I am :smiley:) more familiar with AFNetworking than with [Unirest for Objective-C](http://unirest.io/objective-c), used in their example. Not only this, but the `success`/`failure` completion blocks and `AFHTTPSessionManager`, and the whole structure of `AFNetworking` are much better. For this reason, I decided to build a Mashape client on top of `AFNetworking`.",
