  "summary": "Framework for casting content to Google Cast devices",
  "description": "Google Cast is a screen-sharing technology that lets a user send and control audio or video content from a small computing device (such as a phone, tablet, or laptop) to a large display device like a television.  A sender application running on the sender device uses the Google Cast API appropriate to its operating system to discover and transmit to the receiver application running on the receiver device. You can use the sender APIs to enable your iOS app to send content to a large display.  Your use of Google Cast SDK is subject to, and by using or downloading any of the related files you agree to comply with, the Google APIs Terms of Service (https://developers.google.com/terms/) and the Google Cast SDK Additional Developer Terms of Service (https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/terms/).",
