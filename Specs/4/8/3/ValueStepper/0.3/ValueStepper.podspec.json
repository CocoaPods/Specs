  "description": "ValueStepper is an improved replication of Apple's UIStepper object. The problem with UIStepper is that it doesn't display the value to the user. I was tired of creating a simple UILabel just to show the value in the UI. ValueStepper integrates the value in a UILabel between the increase and decrease buttons. It's as easy as that.",
