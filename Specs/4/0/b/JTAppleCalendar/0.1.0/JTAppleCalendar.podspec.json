  "description": "This should be the first and last calendar control you ever try.\nThis calendar is different from others in that it is highly configurable with minimal code.\nThe problem with other calendars is they try to cram every feature into it hoping it will be enough for the programmer.\nThis is an incorrect way to build controls. Take a look at UITableView; do you see Apple building what they think you want\nthe UITableView to look like? No. So neither should we. Interested? Try a pod install today. Let's make this the only calendar\npod any will ever want to try.",
