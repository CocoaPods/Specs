  "description": "ConvivaAppAnalytics is a mobile and event analytics platform with a difference: rather than tell our users how they should analyze their data, we deliver their event-level data in their own data warehouse, on their own Amazon Redshift or Postgres database, so they can analyze it any way they choose. ConvivaAppAnalytics mobile is used by data-savvy games companies and app developers to better understand their users and how they engage with their games and applications.",
