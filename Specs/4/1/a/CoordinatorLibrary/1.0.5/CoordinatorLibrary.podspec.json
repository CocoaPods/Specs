  "summary": "CoordinatorLibrary is a library to help simplify working with the 'Coordinator Pattern'",
  "description": "CoordinatorLibrary is based on the 'Coordinator Pattern' which attempts to solve the problem of 'Seperation of concerns' by seperating navigation flow logic from a UIViewController and abstracting navigation into it's own object, allowing for reusability of ViewControllers. The library helps make it simpler to adopt/use the 'Coordinator Pattern'",
