  "description": "SDLoopingVideoView is a looping video-view that supports light and dark mode videos based off of AVPlayerLayer; it works great when used as a video background (see below for list of apps using SDLoopingVideoView). SDLoopingVideoView automatically scales any video displayed to aspect-fill the view you define; scaling can be set manually as well. SDLoopingVideoView responds to any UIView animations and scales accordingly without interuption of the video playing.",
