  "description": "A simple parser combinator, created in Swift. Functional parser combinators can be extremely useful but can also be difficult to understand. ParserCombinator attempts to strip this back and create a simple and user friendly way to parse strings into other objects. Technical terms, like mooned, are avoided or explained if necessary and docs are provided in plain English, with examples.",
