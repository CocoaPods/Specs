  "description": "**MRFetchedResultsController** is a drop-in replacement for `NSFetchedResultsController` that works on Mac and iOS.\n\nIts purpose is to provide an alternative that makes it possible to extend `NSFetchedResultsController` functionallity without having to deal with private APIs.\n\nIn apps ported to Mac OS X using [Chameleon](https://github.com/BigZaphod/Chameleon), **MRFetchedResultsController** addresses the lack of an implementation of `NSFetchedResultsController` for the platform by providing an alternative that can be used in both iOS and Mac versions of the apps.",
