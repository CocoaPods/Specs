  "description": "This keychain wrapper was originally created by Apple.\nAdditionally, Xcode warnings were fixed.\n\nThis sample shows how to navigate through the Keychain Services API\nprovided by iOS. Its demonstration leverages the Generic\nKeychain Item class and provides a template on how to successfully set up calls \nto: SecItemAdd, SecItemCopyMatching, SecItemDelete, and SecItemUpdate.\n\nThe user interface is a master-detail designed in Interface Builder, archived in the MainWindow nib.\nThe user interface is modeled on a typical iOS app preferences screen. \n\nThe sample builds two separate applications from the same code base. Both applications\nhave their own keychain item that stores a username and password. Both apps also share\na second keychain item that stores an account number. This takes advantage\nof the shared keychain item capability added in iOS 3.0.",
