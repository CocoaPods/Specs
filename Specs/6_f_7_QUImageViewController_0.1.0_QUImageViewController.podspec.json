  "description": "QUImageViewController is like a \"light box\" for iOS. It's similar to image viewers you may have seen in apps like Twitter, Tweetbot, and others. It presents an image in a full-screen interactive view. Users can pan and zoom, and use Tweetbot-style dynamic gestures to dismiss it with a fun flick.",
