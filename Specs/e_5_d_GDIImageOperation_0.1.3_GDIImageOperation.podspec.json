  "description": "GDIImageOperation is an NSOperation subclass that makes use of NSURLSession for requests, NSCache\nfor in memory caching, and also caches images to disk.\n\nThis project is similar to SDWebImage but is lighter weight and the GDIImageOperation can be \nused independently for custom download tasks. GDIImageOperation also uses iOS7+ APIs and supports\nusing custom NSURLSession and custom configuration for caching rules.\n\nThis project also includes a category on UIImageView to asynchronous loading images from cache,\nor network, when necessary.",
