  "description": "TSAO is an implementation of type-safe associated objects in Swift. \nObjective-C associated objects are useful, but they are also untyped; \nevery associated object is only known to be id at compile-time and \nclients must either test the class at runtime or rely on it being the \nexpected type.",
