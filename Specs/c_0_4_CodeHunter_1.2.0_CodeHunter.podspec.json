  "summary": "A drop in pod that allows you to customize a barcode scanner & specify criteria for the barcode",
  "description": "This allows you to specify both the type(s) of barcode(s) you want to accept, as well as specify criteria around what they can contain. Specifying type is done through the Barcode enum, which aligns with the supported types AVFoundation has. You can specify acceptable barcode values by either providing parameters to two prebuilt methods, or you can provide your own custom regex expression for more complex values. This pod is also able to determine if it is being run against a simulator, and will avoid launching the scanner if it is.",
