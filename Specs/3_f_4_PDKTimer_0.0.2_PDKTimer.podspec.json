  "description": "                    A simple swift GCD based Timer\n                    NSTimer is an Objective-C class that needs a @selector to call. As in swift, we don't have selectors, whe have to pass a String with the name of the function we want to be called\n                    Wouldn't it be nice if whe could pass a closure to the timer?\n",
