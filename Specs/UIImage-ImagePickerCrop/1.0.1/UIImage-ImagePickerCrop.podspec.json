  "description": "                   The UIImagePickerController class includes a parameter (allowsEditing) that lets the user move and scale the image and crop it to a square shape.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe info dictionary returned as part of the UIImagePickerControllerDelegate protocol includes an \"edited\" version of the image, but its resolution is limited to a relatively small size.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the dictionary also contains a pointer to the full-resolution image along with the the value for the UIImagePickerControllerCropRect key, which is a CGRect corresponding to the area selected by the user.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnfortunately grabbing a chunk of a UIImage from the device camera is not completely trivial, as the image data is always stored in the device's native orientation with a flag indicating that it should be rotated before being displayed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSo a bit of low-level CoreGraphics-fu is required to rotate and translate the image before selecting the relevant area and drawing it to a CGContext.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis category on UIImage does that in order to create a cropped image at the maximum possible resolution.\n",
