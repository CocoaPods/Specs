  "summary": "Enhanced transitioning between UICollectionView layouts in iOS.",
  "description": "TLLayoutTransitioning provides a `TLLayoutTransition` transition layout subclass and a `UICollectionView+TLTransitioning` category that combine to solve a few problems with collection view layout transitioning:\n\n1. `UICollectionViewLayoutTransition` does not handle content offset well, often leaving cells where you don't want them. `TLTransitionLayout` provides elegant control of content offset with Minimal, Visible, Center, Top, Left, Bottom or Right placement options relative to one or more index paths.\n\n2. `UICollectionViewLayoutTransition` does not support supplementary views. `TLTransitionLayout` provides support for any supplementary view kinds specified in the initializer.\n\n3. `-[UICollectionView setCollectionViewLayout:animated:completion]` has [serious known bugs][3] in iOS7 and does not provide any animation options. TLLayoutTransitioning provides a robust alternative to this API with support for animation duration, 30+ easing curves and content offset control. This is done by using `CADisplayLink` to drive an interactive `TLTransitionLayout` as a non-interactive animation.\n\nCheck out the demos in the Examples workspace!\n\nChanges in 1.0.10\n* Move c function declarations out of interface to make Swift happy",
