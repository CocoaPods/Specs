  "summary": "A library for performing 2D voronoi tesselations in Objective C for iOS apps.",
  "description": "This is an iOS friendly, Objective-C version of Fortune's Algorithm based on Clay Heaton's Objective-C port. Using these classes, you can create Voronoi tessellations from sets of points in a cartesian plane. The library provides no graphical representation of the tessellation - it is merely an engine.\n\nThere are classes for fundamental Voronoi concepts (such as Cells, Sites, Edges, Vertices, etc) as well as classes related to Fortune's Algorithm (BeachSection, CircleEvent, etc).\n\nGenealogy:\n\n- Steven Fortune's initial C implementation can be found at his Bell Labs home page: http://ect.bell-labs.com/who/sjf/\n- Raymond Hill's JavaScript implementation of Fortune's algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi\n- Clay Heaton's Objective-C port of Raymond Hill's implementation can be found here: https://github.com/clayheaton/objcvoronoi\n- A detailed explanation of Fortune's algorithm can be found at Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%27s_algorithm",
