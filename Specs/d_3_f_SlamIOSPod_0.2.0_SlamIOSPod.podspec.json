  "description": "Target/Actions, Delegates, Data Sources and even Subclassing are all traditional elements under Objected Oriented programming for iOS & Mac OS.  While they will never be replaced, there are often times when such patterns are cumbersome and time consuming. A simplier methology is to use Closures to change or expand the functionality of elements. Slam is a user interface Framework for iOS/Mac that provides basic views that provide this option. Instead of Targe/Actions, buttons & switches have the property actionClosure, which is invoked when the field is clicked on.  Instead of Data Sources that provide information regarding cells for a TableViews, closure provied this information.",
