  "description": "ISHPullUp provides a simple UIViewControlller subclass with two child controllers. The layout can be managed entirely via delegation and is easy to use with autolayout. A pan gesture allows the user to drag the bottom view controller up or down. \n\nView subclasses are provided to make beautiful iOS 10 style designs easier. ISHPullUpHandleView provides a drag handle as seen in the notification center or Maps app with three states: up, neutral, down. ISHPullUpRoundedView (and ISHPullUpRoundedVisualEffectView) provides the perfect backing view for your bottom view controller with a hairline border, rounded top corners,Â and a shadow.",
