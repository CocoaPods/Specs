  "description": "##UIView Animation Extensions \n\nA **useful** `UIView` category containing a set of most commonly used animations like rotation, flip, shake and others.\n\nIt is designed to be **as easy to use and integrate as possible** with a goal to speed up everyday development tasks. All the methods are well documented and described. \n\nFurthermore, the category comes along with **a small demo project** where you can see the animations in action.\n\n# Animations \nExtension contains helper methods for the following animations:\n## Rotation\n```objective-c\n[boxView rotateToAngle:M_PI * 2.0f\n              duration:1.0f\n             direction:UIViewAnimationRotationDirectionLeft\n           repeatCount:HUGE_VALF\n           autoreverse:YES];\n```\n![Rotation](https://i.imgur.com/MjlgVKj.gif)\n\n## Flip\n```objective-c\n[boxView flipWithDuration:0.3f\n                direction:UIViewAnimationFlipDirectionFromLeft\n              repeatCount:2\n              autoreverse:NO];\n```\n\n![Flip](https://i.imgur.com/fmiWQaj.gif)\n\n## Vertical Shake\n```objective-c\n[boxView shakeVertically];\n```\n![Vertical Shake](https://i.imgur.com/Z9zgPkE.gif)\n \n## Horizontal Shake\n```objective-c\n[boxView shakeHorizontally];\n```\n![Horizontal Shake](https://i.imgur.com/JX1FWKZ.gif)\n \n## Pulse\n```objective-c\n[boxView pulseToSize:1.1f\n            duration:0.3f\n              repeat:YES];\n```\n![Pulse](https://i.imgur.com/EEhMxJV.gif)\n\n## Motion Effects\n```objective-c\n[boxView applyMotionEffects];\n```\nCan't be shown in a gif. Run on the device to see it in action.\n\n# Thread Safety\n\nUIView Animation Extensions is a category on `UIView` and - as with all `UIKit` components - it should only be accessed from the main thread.",
