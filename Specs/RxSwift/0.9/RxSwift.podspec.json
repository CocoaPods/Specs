  "description": "\t\t\tThis is a Swift port of Reactive extensions.\n\n\t\t\t[https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions)\n\n\t\t\tLike the original Rx, its intention is to enable easy composition of asynchronous operations and event streams.\n\n\t\t\tIt tries to port as many concepts from the original Rx as possible, but some concepts were adapted for more pleasant and performant integration with iOS/OSX environment.\n\n\t\t\tProbably the best analogy for those who have never heard of Rx would be:\n\n\n\t\t\t```\n\t\t\tgit diff | grep bug | less          #  linux pipes - programs communicate by sending\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    #  sequences of bytes, words, lines, '\u0000' terminated strings...\n\t\t\t```\n\t\t\twould become if written in RxSwift\n\t\t\t```\n\t\t\tgitDiff() >- grep(\"bug\") >- less    // rx sink (>-) operator - rx units communicate by sending\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    // sequences of swift objects\n\t\t\t```\n",
