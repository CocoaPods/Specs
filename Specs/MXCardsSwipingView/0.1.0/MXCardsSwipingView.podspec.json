  "description": "It's a lightweight `UIView` to extract the pan gesture and animations involved in the card swiping\nparadigm which has become so popular. Other card-swiping libraries try to do too much IMO and make it\nhard to customize. To use it, you simply instantiate a `MXCardsSwipingView` and enqueue cards. You can\nenqueue more cards when its delegate methods are called.  And the card you enqueue can optionally conform to the\n`MXSwipableCard` protocol to provide additional customizability (e.g. fading views in on swipe left or right).",
