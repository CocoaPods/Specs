  "description": "Simplify the process of using the new 3D Touch shortcuts for apps.\nGet callbacks when a shortcut is invoked and don't do everything\ninside the AppDelegate like Apple's sample project.\n\nI wanted a way to take action on shortcut launches in the view controller\nthat was supposed to handle the actions. I don't like the format of using\nview controllers from within the AppDelegate. It just seems messy. So this\nwrapper provides a delegate method to alert a class when a shortcut is invoked.",
