It includes methods to grab the screenshot directly as a UIImage, share it via a UIActivityViewController, save it to the camera roll or write it directly to the app sandbox in the Documents directory.\n\n    This class is most useful in combination with [Status Magic](http://shinydevelopment.com/status-magic/) for putting perfect status bars on screenshots ready for use in an App Store listing.\n",
