And then there's dealing with Dynamic Type.\n\nFont allows you to deal with fonts in a strongly-typed manner with no pain when it comes to Dynamic Type.\n\n* Register your custom font and its sizes\n* Implement it\n* Register something to update the font size when the Dynamic Font size changes\n* Keep being awesome",
