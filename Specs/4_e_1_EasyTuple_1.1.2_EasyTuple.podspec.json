  "description": "Sometimes you may need to return multiple values other than just one. In these cases, you can use a pointer, like `NSError **`, or you can put them into an array or a dictionary, or straightforward, create a class for it. But you have another choice now, EasyTuple, it can group multiple values in a better way.",
