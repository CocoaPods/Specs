  "summary": "A sane alternative to UITextView (since UITextView is broken beyond repair in iOS 7).",
  "description": "UITextView is utterly broken on iOS 7. JTSTextView is an otherwise vanilla\nUIScrollView, except it manages a private UITextView subview. This private\ntext view is of a fixed height (100,000 points) and it has its scrolling\nimplicitly disabled because it's frame height is effectively always taller\nthan it's contentSize.height. By using a fixed height and disabling\nscrolling, this bypasses all the bad math that otherwise breaks UITextView.\n\nTo make JTSTextView useful, it has a bunch of public properties and methods\nthat mimic the properties, methods, and delegate protocols of UITextView proper.\n",
