  "description": "                    SHObjectUserInfo is a category on top of NSObject to allow userInfo dictionary without the swizzling. It's built on top of NSMapTable that works with weakToWeak references between an object and its userInfo.\n\n\n                    * No need to clean up after - userInfo are self maintained.\n                    * Weak referenced blocks.\n                    * No swizzling or hacks.\n                    * Name-scoped selectors.\n                    * Works with existing codebase that uses userInfo dictionaries on them.\n\n",
