  "description": "A device-orientation-conscious drawing view. For example if you draw an arrow pointing to the home button of your device, and rotate it, the OrientedDrawingView will readjust the drawing to make the arrow keep pointing at the home button.\n\nInspired by ACEDrawingView, and provides similar functionality to ACEDrawingView's pen tool, including undoing and setting line width and color.",
