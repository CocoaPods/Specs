  "description": "I built this library because I'm rewriting [RouletteBetter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roulettebetter-odds-calculator-betting-strategies-for/id310598685?mt=8) and I wanted a way to make *lot* of statistics calculation on vectors. To do so, we can use the [iOS Accelerate framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate) to 'Make large-scale mathematical computations and image calculations, optimized for high performance'. Unfortunately the Accelerate framework wants basic c pointer array as input/output parameters, so we can't use NSMutableArray or high level NSObjects.\n\nWith this wrapper library, we can easily create and manupulate the c pointer array as an high level object and, whenewer we need it, access the low level pointer property (for example to pass it to the Accelerate framework c functions).",
