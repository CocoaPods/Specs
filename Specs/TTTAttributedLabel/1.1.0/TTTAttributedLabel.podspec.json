  "description": "TTTAttributedLabel is a drop-in replacement for UILabel that supports NSAttributedStrings. NSAttributedString is pretty rad. When it was ported into iOS 4 from Mac OS, iPhone developers everywhere rejoiced. Unfortunately, as of iOS 4 none of the standard controls in UIKit support it. Bummer. TTTAttributedLabel was created to be a drop-in replacement for UILabel, that provided a simple API to styling text with NSAttributedString while remaining performant. As a bonus, it also supports link embedding, both automatically with UIDataDetectorTypes and manually by specifying a range for a URL, address, phone number, or event.",
