  "description": "The WSSpeechManager allows you to detect words with the Speech API and execute callback blocks when a specific word/phrase is detected. Since it handles Audio inputs, we've also included methods to play custom and system sounds, to make it easier to handle the Audio Buffers (input + output) and avoid crashes due to forbidden accesses.",
