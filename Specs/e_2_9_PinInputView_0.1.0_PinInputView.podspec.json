You can easily customize the fonts and colors. It resizes automatically according to its configuration.\n### Features\n- Custolizable font and color.\n- As many digits as you need (from 1 to +∞).\n- AutoLayout compatible (`intrinsicContentSize` updated according to the configuration).\n- Interface-Builder compatible.\n- Pure Swift 4.\n- Open project: you have an issue or an idea ? Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/jlnquere/PinInputView/issues/new), or submit a PR :)",
