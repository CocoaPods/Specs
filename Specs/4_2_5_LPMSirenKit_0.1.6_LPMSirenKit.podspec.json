  "description": "                        `LPMSirenKit` is a lightweight library for interacting with [Hypermedia APIs](http://www.hypermediaapi.com) that adhere to the [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren) specification.\n\n                        `LPMSirenKit` sits on top of `AFNetworking` and submits requests on behalf of the application. The library will parse the results and cache the entity, link, action, and field objects. The `properties` for the entity objects are not cached at this level (the library only caches those things that are necessary for navigation).\n",
