  "description": "With PhotoLibraryManager you can ask for user permission to access photo library. If you gain access you get some great features including checking if an album already exists, making a new album with your custom name, save a photo to your album, check if a photo exists, get a photo with specific identifier, delete a photo etc. If the user denied access, an alert window can lead him to app settings in order to change permission if he wants to.",
