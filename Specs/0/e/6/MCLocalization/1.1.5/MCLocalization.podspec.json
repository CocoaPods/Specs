  "description": "There is the \"standard\" way Apple of localizing iOS apps using NSLocalizedString. It's versatile enought and you should stick to it unless you have good reasons not to.\n\nI reuse the same localization files in an iOS app, on a web site and, possibly, in an app made for another platform. Advantage of JSON there is that libraries for handling JSON are available for just about any modern platform.\n\nAs a side advantage, it is much easier to create tools which do not rely on localizers being proficient with escaping C strings or use translation services not geared towards iOS app localization.",
