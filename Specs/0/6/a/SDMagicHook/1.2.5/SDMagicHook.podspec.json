  "description": "Classical method swizzling with method_exchangeImplementations is quite simple, but it has a lot of limitations and defects:\n\nYou have to add a new method in a class category everytime when you want to swizzle a method.\nDifferent method implementation with same selector in different category will case method conflicts.\nThe method swizzling will affect all the instances of the target class，however in most cases it is not necessary but even has side effects.\n\nNow SDMagicHook will solve the problems mentioned above.",
