  "description": "Simple implementation (2 files) of classic Popover well known from iOS Apps. From time to time we need display some short info connected to view on screen or as context menu. Standard implementation based on `UIPopoverPresentationController` is hard to customize and Swifty Popover was created as answer to that issue.",
