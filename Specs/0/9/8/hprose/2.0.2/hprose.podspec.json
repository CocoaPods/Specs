  "description": "Hprose is a High Performance Remote Object Service Engine.\n\nIt is a modern, lightweight, cross-language, cross-platform, object-oriented, high performance, remote dynamic communication middleware. It is not only easy to use, but powerful. You just need a little time to learn, then you can use it to easily construct cross language cross platform distributed application system.\n\nHprose supports many programming languages, for example:\n\n* AAuto Quicker\n* ActionScript\n* ASP\n* C++\n* Dart\n* Delphi/Free Pascal\n* dotNET(C#, Visual Basic...)\n* Golang\n* Java\n* JavaScript\n* Node.js\n* Objective-C\n* Perl\n* PHP\n* Python\n* Ruby\n* ...\n\nThrough Hprose, You can conveniently and efficiently intercommunicate between those programming languages.\n\nThis project is the implementation of Hprose for Objective-C.",
