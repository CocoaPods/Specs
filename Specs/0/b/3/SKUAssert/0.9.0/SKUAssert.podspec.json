  "description": "                   SKUAssert provides assertion handlers that are:\n\n                     * Saner: because they don't invisibly call `self` and cause\n                       memory leaks when included in blocks\n\n                     * Safer: because `SKUAssertOrCatch` encourages you to handle\n                       exceptional cases both during development and in production\n\n                   For those cases where you cannot recover and need to abort,\n                   `SKUAssertOrAbort` will also improve your crash reports by adding\n                   the reason for the assertion failure to the aborting thread's name.\n",
