  "summary": "An EDN (Extensible Data Notation) Objective C library for OS X and iOS.",
  "description": "    The library includes:\n\n    * `MPEdnParser`, a parser for reading EDN and generating equivalent Cocoa data\n      structures.\n\n    * `MPEdnWriter`, which writes Cocoa data structures as EDN.\n\n    For most uses, parsing EDN is as simple as:\n\n        [@\"{:a 1}\" ednStringToObject];\n\n    Which returns the parsed object or nil on error.\n\n    And to generate EDN from a Cocoa object:\n\n        [myObject objectToEdnString];\n\n    See the headers for API docs.\n",
