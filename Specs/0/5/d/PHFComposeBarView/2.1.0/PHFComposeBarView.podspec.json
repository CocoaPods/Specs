This class is\nan exact reconstruction of the compose bar and behaves exactly like it. It is\nconfigurable in terms of maximium height the input view can grow. By specifying\na maximum text length a counter is shown, similar to composing an SMS. You can\nalso specify an image for the utility button on the left of the input which\ncauses that button to become visible. Further, the color of the send button can\nbe customized.",
