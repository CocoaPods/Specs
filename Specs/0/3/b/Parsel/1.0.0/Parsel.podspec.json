  "description": "Parsing is a very common task, it does not always mean to parse source code or JSON strings. Parsing means to transform an unstructured input to a structured output. In case of source code this means to parse a raw string to an AST (abstract syntax tree), in case of an addition it means to parse the result of adding two numbers out of a string. Parsing can always fail, if the input does not match the needed grammer. If the input string in the above example would have been 1+, it would have been failed because the second number is missing. The advantage of parser combinators is that you start with a very basic parser. In the above example digit parses only one digit. But it is not hard, to add a parser that parses more than one digit. A number is a repetition of mulitple digits. For repetition, we can use rep, which tries to apply the parser until it fails and collects the result as an array.",
