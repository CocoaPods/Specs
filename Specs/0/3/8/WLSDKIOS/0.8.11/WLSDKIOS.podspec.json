  "description": "'The first phase will be large  but as simple as possible.  We will start with the basic idea of adding a function for each API call.  Where possible, please make the use of the SDK as simple as possible.  Also please document extensively in your code.  We will need to produce documentation at some point.  This documentation can either be written later, based on your source code comments / annotations, or you can choose to write it as you go if you find that easier, but then you would have to keep both up to date as things change.  Where, in the code, you have asynchronous background calls being used, the SDK should support this.  Where, in your code, you may have a queue of calls or uploads to make, the SDK should support this.  all error handling must remain, but be altered to suit its new location within the SDK.  This could mean, for example, throwing specific types of Exceptions for each of the known possible responses from an API endpoint, and then within the code, those Exceptions are caught and handled in the same way we handle those situations today.  All possible Exceptions to each API endpoint need to be documented.  We don’t want to loose functionality, we just want to move it to the SDK. '",
