  "description": "I have a frequent need for loading an app that does a number of specified actions upon clicking a \nbutton. To simplify this process for future use, just subclass `MultiActionDemoViewController`\n(or instantiate one and add some `Action`s). It will handle all the boilerplate layout of the\nbuttons for you.\n\nThat's really all there is to it.",
