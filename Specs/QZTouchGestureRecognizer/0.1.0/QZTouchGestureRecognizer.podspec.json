  "description": "                   This gesture recognizer is great for when you don't want to create a UIView subclass just to get the benefits of touch methods (e.g. touchesBegan:withEvent:).  This gesture recognizer will recognize any touch events on its associated views and cause the action methods to be fired.\n",
