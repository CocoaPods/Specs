  "description": "Like Flux's dispatcher, this library is a part of implementation of flux pattern.\nIt mainly be used for inter-module communication.\nConsider the scene, module A calls module B, then A needs callbacks from B. MFRouter is not suitable for this scene, we want a type-safe, simple, easy to use solution.\nThis is a maybe solution, A calls B with a event dispatcher, you can consider it as a unidirection pipeline, A observes events from the event dispatcher, B dispatcher events to A with the event dispatcher.\nTo be type-safe, we encourage the called module defines events need to be dispatched.",
