  "description": "SlackTextViewController doesn't have a lot of activity or [releases](https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController/releases) these days, but it's such a useful library and a solid alternative to other great messaging libraries it would be sad to see it die a silent death.\n\nFor some apps simplicity is best and utilizing a UITableView or UICollectionView for messaging is perfect but there needs to be a little more provided to better utilize them as messaging apps. That's where MessengerKit comes in. It's simply a UITableViewController, or UICollectionViewController, and you have full control over the experience, but with a little splash of magic sauce on top to help craft the ideal messaging feature.",
