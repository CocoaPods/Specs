  "description": "BPBarButtonItem is a tool for making awesome looking custom UIBarButtonItems on the fly. BPBarButtonItem is **NOT** a subclass of `UIBarButtonItem` but an `NSObject` which creates skinned plain `UIBarButtonItem`s for use however you want. BPBarButtonItem can also be used to skin `UIBarButtonItem`s which have already been created, like in a nib or Storyboard. Generated buttons have support for both orientation styles.",
