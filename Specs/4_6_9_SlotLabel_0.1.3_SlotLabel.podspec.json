The developer interface consists of override properties for configuring\nthe label to fit your exact needs, as well as simple to use one liners that will animate your\nlabel to the string you specify. Out of the box the you can customize the SlotLabel font, text\ncolor, animation speed, and many of the other options you would expect out of any UILabel\ndrop-in replacement.",
