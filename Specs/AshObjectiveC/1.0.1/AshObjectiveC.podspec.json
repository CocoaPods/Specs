  "description": "                   Ash is a high-performance entity system framework for game development.\n                   An entity system is a way to organise the code for a game that is efficient for both code execution and code management.\n                   It uses composition rather than inheritance for sharing features between game objects and uses a data-oriented approach to separate the game state from the game logic.\n                   This makes it much easier to manage the code and to manage the game state.\n",
