  "summary": "Add the missing network activity indicator on iPhone X",
  "description": "iPhone X does not display the network activity indicator anymore. This pod brings it\nback by placing an activity indicator in the upper left of the screen on top of the\nregular status bar items. Since a circular indicator wouldn't fit, a rectangular \n\"KITT scanner\" like indicator with a gradient is shown. The indicator UI can be\nused standalone or as a \"fix\" for the iOS network activity indicator (using the\nexisting API).",
