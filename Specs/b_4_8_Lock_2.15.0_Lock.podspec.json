  "description": "[![Auth0](https://i.cloudup.com/1vaSVATKTL.png)](http://auth0.com)\n\nAuth0 is a SaaS that helps you with Authentication and Authorization. You can use Social Providers (Like Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.), Enterprise Providers (Active Directory, LDap, Windows Azure AD, SAML, etc.) and a Username/Password store which can be saved either by us or by you. We have SDKs for the most common platforms (Ruby, Node, iOS, Angular, etc.) so that with a couple lines of code, you can get the Authentication for your app implemented. Let us worry about Authentication so that you can focus on the core of your business.",
