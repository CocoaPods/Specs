Heckel, by making use of ListDiff\n* Optimize diff with some heuristics for large number of rows\n* Skip diffing for currently invisible sections (use reload)\n  * Section-wise diff for currently (partially or completely) visible sections\n  * Skip applying diff when many deletions detected (> 300), for each section",
