  "description": "Are you sure tired of writing the same code in all view controllers? Now you can easily and simply call up the necessary states for display, WaterStates will do the rest.\n\nInside, a StateMachine is used that determines the delay and decides when to show, hide, or skip the state display.\n\nInstructions for installation are in [the README](https://github.com/BarredEwe/WaterStates).",
