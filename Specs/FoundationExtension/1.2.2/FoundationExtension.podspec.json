This library does not includes high-level data structure, algorithm or frameworks, but collection of code snippets.\n* Many common snippets in a method call.\n* Looks like native foundation methods - It follows Apple Coding Guideline and Foundation naming convention.\nSee document on [Github] (http://youknowone.github.com/FoundationExtension)\n\nTry FoundationExtension for Foundation extensions.\nFor iOS, UIKitExtension is available too.",
