  "summary": "An approachable iOS forms framework for building beautiful, reusable and easy to maintain forms.",
  "description": "Astro Forms is a framework that provides the structure to build your own highly custom and reusable forms for a project. \nIn this way it's different to other frameworks - it's specifically not a drop in set of subclassable elements or abstraction around UIKit. \nInstead, it's a set of protocols and a minimum of abstract classes you compose to build your forms. \nThis is an opinionated way of doing things, however you'll have far less code (less üêõs) and far more flexibility for anything but trivial stock-standard looking forms.",
