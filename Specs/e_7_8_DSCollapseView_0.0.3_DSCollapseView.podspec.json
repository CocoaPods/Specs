  "description": "A quick and easy way to make any UIView collapse on dragging. All you have to do is assign your view which you want to collapse, to DSCollapseView Class. That easy ! But not all requirements are the same right ? So, you get to set the minimum height property, animation/translation type of collapsing of subviews, even show another view when your view is collaped. Check out ReadMe to get started !! Also, suggestions and feedbacks are always open :)",
