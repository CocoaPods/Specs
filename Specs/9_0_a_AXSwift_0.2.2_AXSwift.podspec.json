  "description": "AXSwift is a Swift wrapper for OS X's C-based accessibility client APIs. Working with these APIs\nis error-prone and a huge pain, so AXSwift makes everything easier:\n\n- Modern API that's 100% Swift\n- Explicit error handling\n- Complete coverage of the underlying C API\n- Better documentation than Apple's, which is pretty poor\n\nThis framework is intended as a basic wrapper and doesn't keep any state or do any \"magic\".\nThat's up to you!",
