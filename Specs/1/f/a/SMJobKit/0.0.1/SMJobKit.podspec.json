  "description": "Using SMJobBless and friends is rather ...painful. SMJobKit does everything in its power to alleviate that and get you back to writing awesome OS X apps.\n\nSMJobKit is more than just a framework/library to link against. It gives you:\n- A Xcode target template for SMJobBless-ready launchd services, completely configured for proper code signing!\n- A client abstraction that manages installing/upgrading your app's service(s).\n- A service library that pulls in as little additional code as possible. Less surface area for security vulnerabilities!\n"
