  "description": "LaunchGate makes it easy to let users know when an update\nto your app is available.\n\nYou can also block access to the app for older versions,\nwhich is useful in the event of a severe bug or security\nissue that requires users to update the app.\n\nAdditionally, you can use LaunchGate to display a remotely\nconfigured message to users at launch which can also be\nused to temporarily block access to the app (i.e. during\nback-end maintenance).",
