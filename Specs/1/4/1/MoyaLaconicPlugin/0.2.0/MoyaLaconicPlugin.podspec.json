  "description": "MoyaLaconicPlugin logs your Moya requests and their responses using a short message for each.\nIn an application with many network calls, sometimes it is enough to just know when a request is fired and when its response comes back.\nImplement the Laconic protocol and assign an identifier to your endpoints.\nMoyaLaconicPlugin will use these and write into the Console a one-line message, together with the status code of each response.",
