  "description": "                   DKNightVersion is a light weight framework. It is mainly built through `objc/runtime` library and reflection, providing a neat approach  adding night mode to your iOS app. A great many codes of this framework is automatically generated by Ruby script.\n\n                   The most delightful feature of DKNightVersion is that it appends one more property `nightColor` to frequently-used UIKit components and provides you a default night mode theme. It is easily-used and well-designed. Hope you have a great joy to use DKNightVersion to integrate night mode in your Apps.\n",
