  "description": "A very simple CountryPicker in Swift, which is super easy to implement. It uses emoji as flags, so it's size is as low as possible. When a user has selected a country you can retreieve it's name and flag, but most importantly: it's ISO code. It's a subclass UIPickerView that displays country names and flags in a slot machine interface. Customization is very easy, because it's a UIPickerView suvlcass.\ndescription",
