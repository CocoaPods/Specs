  "summary": "A framework designed to make app routing simpler and safer.",
  "description": "Scotty provides a simple abstraction around the various entry points to an iOS application. URLs, UIApplicationShortcutItems, NSUserActivities, UNNotificationResponses, and even custom types can be converted into a Route. These routes represent the various destinations your app can deep link too, allowing you to have a single code path through which all application links are executed.",
