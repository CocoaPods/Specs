  "description": "This pod installs the iOS version of the cross-platform ANSI C based Nabto Edge Client API library. Also see the NabtoEdgeClientSwift pod for a high level wrapper in Swift.\n\nThe Nabto Edge communication platform enables you to establish direct connections from a client to even the most resource constrained devices, regardless of the firewall configuration of each peer - a P2P middleware that supports IoT well.\n\nThe platform has been designed from the ground and up with strong security as a focal point. All in all, it enables vendors to create simple, high performant and secure solutions for their Internet connected products with very little effort.\n\nThe Nabto Edge platform supersedes the Nabto Micro platform with many new features and capabilities.
