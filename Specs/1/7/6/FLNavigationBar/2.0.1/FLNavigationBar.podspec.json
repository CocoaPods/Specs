  "description": "A drop-in universal library helps you to manage the navigation bar styles and makes transition animations smooth between different navigation bar styles while pushing or popping a view controller for all orientations. And you don't need to write any line of code for it, it all happens automatically. \n                 The design concept of the library is that what you only need to care about is the background style of the navigation bar in the *current* view controller, without handling the various background styles while pushing or popping.",
