  "summary": "Remotely tweak and change colours, fonts, style and design parameters without recompiling your app.",
  "description": "UIDesignKit fills the need for allowing users to change things like the background colour of a label or the font of text on a button from a remote website in realtime. This means that developers can concentrate on the application logic and layout of the app rather than the precise design values. This also works well for multitennanted application support for different designs per tennant.",
