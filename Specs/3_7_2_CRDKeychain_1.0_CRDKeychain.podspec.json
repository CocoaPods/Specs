  "description": "I recently had a need to create a way to access the macOS and iOS keychain from within a Swift-based app I was developing. Although there are several extensive libraries out there for this very purpose, I found that they were pretty complex and involved a lot of code. I needed something that was small and compact and easy to add to any project. I decided to create my own as a framework that will work in both macOS and iOS projects.",
