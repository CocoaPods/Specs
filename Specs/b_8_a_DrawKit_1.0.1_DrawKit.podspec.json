  "description": "DrawKit is a software framework that enables the Mac OS X developer to rapidly implement vector drawing and illustration features in a custom application. It is comprehensive, powerful and complete, but it is also highly modular so you can make use of only those parts that you need, or go the whole hog and drop it in as a complete vector drawing solution.",
