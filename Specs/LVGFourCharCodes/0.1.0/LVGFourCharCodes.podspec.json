  "description": "This framework is used to convert four-byte integer types like OSStatus, UInt32, Int32, etc., to the four-character string. It is useful in debugging functions that return OSStatus error codes, or getting the four-character description of a property that is defined by a constant. It also extends String to add a property called `code` that will convert a four-character String to a `UInt32`.",
