  "description": "For some reason, neither Apple, nor any other JSON serialization library for Swift supports ordered JSON. This fixes it.\nEven though the JSON RFC specifies that the order is not important for JSON documents, in some cases, ordering is desired.\nWith Swift's native .sortedKeys WritingOption, this is partially supported, but only on the top-level of the document.\nGiven Dictionary's unsorted fashion of storing items, when using JSON documents as queries, this randomness preventsa caching\non a CDN. For this case, there's OrderedJSONSerialization.",
