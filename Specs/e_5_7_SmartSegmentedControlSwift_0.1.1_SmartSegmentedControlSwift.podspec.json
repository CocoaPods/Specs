  "summary": "UISegmentedControl replacement which provides more accurate segments width management",
  "description": "This control was created to solve issue, that native UISegmentedControl has. Reffer to SmartSegmentedControl for obj-c version.\nUISegmentedControl has issue with apportionsSegmentWidthsByContent setting (adjust segments width proportionally to content). Often, it appears that control bounds are wider, than actual segments width.\nWith SmartSegmentedControl issue is fixed.\nAlso, SmartSegmentedControl introduces “smart” mode, where, if there is enough room, every segment, that needs to be wider than average width, gets enough room to display content (which is usually less then in proportional mode). If there is no enough room for all content - segments width is distributed proportionally (fixed, of course :) ).\n\nNOTE. SmartSegmentedControl is designed and test only to work with segments with titles, not with images.",
