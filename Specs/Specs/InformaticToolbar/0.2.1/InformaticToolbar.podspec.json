  "description": "                    InformaticToolbar is mainly an UIViewController Category which allows you to add several ___UIBarButtonItem___s set to your toolbar.\n\n                    The sets are defined as subclasses of ___ITBarItemSet___. All ___ITBarItemSet___ can have a ___dismiss button___ if the target and action has been defined. If more than one set has been added, a ___switch button___ (an arrow) will be displayed on the left for user to switch between sets.\n\n                    For now, there are three pre-defined set:\n\n                    - ___ITLabelBarItemSet___: a textLabel and a detailTextLabel\n                    - ___ITProgressBarItemSet___: a textLabel and a progressBar\n                    - ___ITConfirmationBarItemSet___: two label and a check-mark button\n\n                    You can easily create new sets by extending ___ITBarItemSet___ yourself.\n",
