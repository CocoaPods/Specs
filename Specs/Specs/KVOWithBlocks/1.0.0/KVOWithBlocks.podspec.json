  "description": "                   A category on NSObject that allows you observe a\n                   keypath passing in a block to execute when the keypath\n                   changes instead of using a callback method.\n\n                   This works on iOS and OS X.\n\n                   Why? Blocks are funky. They let you define an action at the\n                   same time as you are setting up a observation. In most cases\n                   this leads to clearer code than using a callback.\n",
