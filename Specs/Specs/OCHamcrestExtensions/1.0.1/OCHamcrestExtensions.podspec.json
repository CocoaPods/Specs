  "description": "                      OCHamcrestExtensions is built on top of [OCHamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/OCHamcrest). It adds several more features, including:\n\n                      * Support for exception assertions.\n                      * More matchers.\n\n                      OCHamcrestExtensions is a drop in _replacement_ but does contain all the source code of the original OCHamcrest project. If you try and link both libraries you will get duplicate symbol errors.\n",
