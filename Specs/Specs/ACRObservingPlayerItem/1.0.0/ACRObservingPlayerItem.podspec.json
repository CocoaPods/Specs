  "description": "    I was getting a lot of crashreports with deallocated AVPlayerItem's while a KVO was still active.\n    It was hard to manually remove the KVO when the AVPlayerItem was randomly deallocated from inside a UITableViewCell.\n \n    ACRObservingPlayerItem is a simple wrapper class for AVPlayerItem which handles the observing of some\n    common playback events and safely releases the KVO on deallocation.\n",
