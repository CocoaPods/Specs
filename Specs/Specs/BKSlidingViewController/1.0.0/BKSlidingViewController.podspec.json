  "description": "                       UIPageViewController seems somewhat rigidly designed for paginated content, and is very efficient at lazily instantiating many view controllers with a particular pattern (before/after) and specific spatial metaphors. While it can do many things well, customization is ultimately limited by permissible alterations of the UIPageViewController class.\n\n                       BKSlidingViewController is an open-source substitute for applications desiring view controllers laid out horizontally, presented with a UITabBarController-like API.\n",
