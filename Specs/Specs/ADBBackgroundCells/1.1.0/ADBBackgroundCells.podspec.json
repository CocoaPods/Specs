  "summary": "ADBBackgroundCells allow lazy loading for UITableViewCell objects performing a long time job in background without blocking the UI.",
  "description": "NSInvocationOperation are used under the hood in place of GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) since operations put in a NSOperationQueue object can be canceled. This threading fashion allows optimized long scrolling where a lot of cells are displayed and immediately reused/disappeared, without the obligation to execute the job of no more visible cells. ADBBackgroundCells are block-based and use Objective-C runtime.",
