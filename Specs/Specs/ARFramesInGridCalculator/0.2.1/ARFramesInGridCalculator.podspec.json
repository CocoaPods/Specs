Something most developers have to do many times to display a list of items when it is not a table view or collection view. Initialize with a cell size and information about how to arrange the frames. Optionally add a initial offset and spacing and once it is set to your specific needs, you can just ask a frame for a certain index.This class is well documented. Read the header files for more info.\n",
