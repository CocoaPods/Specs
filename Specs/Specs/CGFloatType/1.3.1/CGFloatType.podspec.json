  "description": "It's easy to forget that `CGFloat` may actually be a `double` despite it's\nname. On 64-bit systems, where `CGFLOAT_IS_DOUBLE` is set to 1 it will actually\nbe a double.\n\nThis may become cumbersome when you are developing an application where you\nwant a single code base which builds for both 32-bit and 64-bit such as when\ndeveloping against the 32-bit simulator and deploying arm64.\n\nCGFloatType is a simple pod which provides helper methods on `NSNumber` to help\ndeal with this. Along with providing various rounding, and various other math\nfunctions which accept a `CGFloat`.",
