  "description": "    Prism is a “lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library” that\n    renders code snippets into syntax highlighted HTML. It is created by Lea\n    Verou, written in JavaScript, and is based on regular expression.\n\n    This library/framework uses JavaScriptCore to perform so-called “server-\n    side rendering” with Prism. It supports most modern OS X versions (I’m not \n    very sure how far back this goes, but at least 10.7+ should be fine) and \n    iOS 7 or later.\n",
