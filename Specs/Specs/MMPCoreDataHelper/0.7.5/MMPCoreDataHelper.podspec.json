  "description": "                       A lightweight helper library for common CoreData tasks providing data access pattern inspired by Active Record, LINQ, and functional programming.\n\n                       Features:\n                       * Thread-safe singleton instance easily accessible from anywhere. No more worrying whether a MOC (NSManagedObjectContext) belongs to the thread or not. The library makes sure that the MOC is local to the whichever thread you're calling the function from.\n                       * Active Record, LINQ-like functional wrapper for common tasks.\n                       * Automatic configuration and initialization (by convention over configuration) by default but manual configuration is still possible.\n                       * Import data directly from CSV file.\n                       * Get notified on errors and other CoreData events using NSNotificationCenter.                       \n",
