  "description": "                       A no-nonsense straightforward helper library providing wrapper functions for common CoreData tasks. Nothing is hidden, no fancy DAO or active record, just a way to simplify plain old CoreData uses. \n\n                       Features:\n                       * Thread-safe singleton instance easily accessible from anywhere. No more worrying whether a MOC belongs to the thread or not.\n                       * Automatic configuration and initialization (by convention over configuration), although manual configuration is still possible.\n                       * Simple functions for common CoreData usage pattern (query all objects, query by key-value, etc.), although direct CoreData access is still possible.\n                       * Get notified on errors and other CoreData events using NSNotificationCenter.\n",
