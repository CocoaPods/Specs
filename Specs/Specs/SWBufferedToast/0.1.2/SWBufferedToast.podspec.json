Plain Toast\n                      A simple dismissable alert with a title, description and action button.\n\n                      2. Notice Toast\n                      An non-dismissable alert used to notify the user of an ongoing task. This alert cannot be dismissed by the user, but can be dismissed using a timer or by calling toast.dismiss.\n\n                      3. Login Toast\n                      A modal login window in the style of a toast.\n\n\n                      All three alert types have a buffering animation that can be turned on and off as necessary. Additionally, you can supply your own images for this buffering animation.\n\n",
