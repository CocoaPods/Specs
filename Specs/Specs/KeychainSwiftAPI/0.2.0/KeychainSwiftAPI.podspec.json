  "description": "                        This Keychain Swift API library is a wrapper of iOS C Keychain Framework.\n                        It allows easily and securely storing sensitive data in secure keychain store\n                        in Swift projects. Interfacing with the original C keychain API is combersome from\n                        Swift, and is prone to errors which lead to security vulnerabilities. This\n                        library is written according to the best security coding practices and guidelines.\n",
