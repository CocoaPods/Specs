  "description": "\t\t\tThis project demonstrates how to get a rough approximation of an iOS or Mac OS X device's location using only data stored on the device. No GPS or internet lookups are involved. The resulting data is only approximately accurate, but probably good enough to determine the country or continent where the device is located.\n",
