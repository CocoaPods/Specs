  "description": "ARCMacro.h realizes compilation of Objective-C source files both in Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) compilation mode and Manual Reference Counting (MRC, non-ARC) compilation mode without changing the compiler switch. This is useful when you provide a library in the source code form for ARC apps and MRC apps. And your code can take advantage of the ARC mode that is much safer.",
