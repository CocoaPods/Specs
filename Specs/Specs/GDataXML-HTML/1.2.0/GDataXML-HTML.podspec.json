  "description": "                   GDataXML implements parts of NSXML so it's easy to parse XML or HTML with a DOM style API including\n                   XPath support.\n                   This fork of the original GDataXML adds support for the HTMLparser module of\n                   libxml2 and allows you to deal with non validating XML in a simple way.\n\n                   * Think: Why did you write this? What is the focus? What does it do?\n                   * CocoaPods will be using this to generate tags, and improve search results.\n                   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.\n                   * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!\n",
