  "description": "                      OCHamcrest is:\n      \n                      * a library of \"matcher\" objects that let you declare rules for whether a\n                        given object matches the criteria or not;\n                      * a framework for writing your own matchers.\n      \n                      Matchers are useful for a variety of purposes, such as UI validation. But\n                      they're most commonly used for writing unit tests that are expressive and\n                      flexible.\n\n                      OCHamcrest is used for both iOS or OS X development, and is compatible with:\n      \n                      * XCTest\n                      * OCUnit (SenTestingKit)\n                      * Kiwi\n                      * Cedar\n                      * GHUnit\n                      * Google Toolbox for Mac (GTM)\n                      * OCMock\n                      * OCMockito\n",
