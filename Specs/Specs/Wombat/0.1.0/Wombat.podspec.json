  "description": "At its core, Wombat is about people, and its strength lies in its ability to see the people behind both the app and the device.\n\nWe help you delight your users by optimizing your interactions with them, earning their trust and respect.\n\nAn equally important value is keeping you delighted in using Wombat.\n\nThis is why we’ve made Wombat ridiculously simple to integrate, and just as easy to use.\n\nIt’s not just another unified dashboard with infinite options. By changing the way we treat our users (that’s you!), Wombat is changing the way users think about apps, and apps think about users.",
