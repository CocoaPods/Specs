  "description": "                   A random color is sometimes useful or just plain fun, but a completely random color is rarely desired.  Instead, you might want a random but fairly dark color, or a random but fairly light color.\n                   \n                   UIColor+RandomColors adds a few methods to grab random colors, and to specify either a lower or upper bound on the value (the lightness or darkness) of the color.\n\nFuture potential ideas that would be great to branch from this and submit a pull request for:\n                   * Set a saturation or hue bound for random colors, so you can get a random color within a slice of the spectrum.\n                   * Choose a random color that matches a given color as defined by a rule such as complementary, contrasting, or triad.\n",
