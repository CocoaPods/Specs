The \"Expand\" and \"Sort & Filter\" sample projects illustrate\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo such issues with side-by-side comparisons of `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`\n\t\t\t\t\tand `VCollectionViewGridLayout`. Note that in iOS7, both of these sample\n\t\t\t\t\tprojects work correctly with `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`, so this library\n\t\t\t\t\tmay not provide any benefit over `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` beyond\n\t\t\t\t\tsticky headers.\n",
