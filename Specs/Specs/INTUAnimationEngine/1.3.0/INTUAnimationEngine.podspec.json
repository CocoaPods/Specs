  "description": "  INTUAnimationEngine makes it easy to build advanced custom animations on iOS.\n\n  INTUAnimationEngine provides a friendly interface to drive custom animations using a CADisplayLink, inspired by the UIView block-based animation API. It enables interactive animations (normally driven by user input, such as a pan or pinch gesture) to run automatically over a given duration. It can also be used to get a callback every frame of an animation.\n\n  INTUAnimationEngine includes an extensive library of easing functions that can be used to customize animation timing. A complete library of interpolation functions is also included to animate any type of value or property, including those that are not animatable by Core Animation.\n",
