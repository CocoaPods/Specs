  "description": "                    SNRHUDKit is a framework that brings missing HUD controls and interface elements to AppKit.\n                    All of the controls are fully compatible with OS X 10.6 and 10.7.\n                    Each of the NSControl subclasses are completely independent (aside from a few categories) so you are free to pick and choose the controls you need instead of using the entire framework.\n",
