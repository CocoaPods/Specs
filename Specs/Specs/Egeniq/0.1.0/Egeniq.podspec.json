If they make our lives easier, they may also make somebody else happy, so we've decided to make them publicly available.\n\n  As-is, no warranties whatsoever, use at your own risk, etc. etc.\n\n  Pull requests with improvements are very much appreciated!\n\n  License: Apache License 2.0 (See LICENSE file)\n\n  Todo:\n  * Overview of what's in here and what you'd use it for\n  * Clean up documentation (especially headers)\n\n  Note: \n  * We're gradually introducing stuff that requires iOS5. For projects that still need to support iOS4, use the 'ios4' branch.\n\n  Have fun!\n\n  The Egeniq Team\n  http://www.egeniq.com\n",
