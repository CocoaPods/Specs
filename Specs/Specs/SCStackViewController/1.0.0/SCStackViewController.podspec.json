  "description": "                  SCStackViewController is a container view controller which allows you to stack other view controllers on the top/left/bottom/right of the root and build custom transitions between them while providing correct physics and appearance calls.\n\n                  SCStackViewController is a little bit from the all the other stack implementations available. It was build with the following points in mind:\n\n                  * Simple to understand and modify\n                  * Left/right and top/bottom stacking\n                  * Correct physics\n                  * Correct appearance calls\n                  * Customizable transitions\n                  * Pagination\n                  * Customizable interaction area\n                  * Completion blocks for everything'\n",
