  "description": "                           CGLTextViewContainer is a lighweight version of Jared Sinclair's excellent workaround to UITextView's notorious update problems. \n                        \n                           It's pretty much just wholesale stolen, but it differs in a few ways: it trusts clients enough to grant them access to the internal text view, cutting the amount of code                        needed by about half. Has-a vs. is-a or pretends-to-be-a. It allows configuration of the text container's height. And it takes into account measurements of the text view's                        inset.\n                        \n                           Original source here:\n                           https://github.com/jaredsinclair/JTSTextView\n                        \n                           Hopefully, iOS 9 will continue the long chain of text improvements on iOS and we won't need these shenanigans anymore. Until then, this does seem to be a good workaround.\n\n",
