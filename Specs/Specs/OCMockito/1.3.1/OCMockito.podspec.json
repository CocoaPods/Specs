  "description": "                    OCMockito is an Objective-C implementation of Mockito, supporting creation, \n                    verification and stubbing of mock objects.\n\n                    Key differences from other mocking frameworks:\n\n                    * Mock objects are always \"nice,\" recording their calls instead of \n                      throwing exceptions about unspecified invocations. This makes tests less fragile.\n                    * No expect-run-verify, making tests more readable. Mock objects \n                      record their calls, then you verify the methods you want.\n                    * Verification failures are reported as unit test failures, \n                      identifying specific lines instead of throwing exceptions. This makes \n                      it easier to identify failures.\n",
