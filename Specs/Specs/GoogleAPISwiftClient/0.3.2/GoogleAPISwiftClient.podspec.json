  "description": "A lot of us probably use at least one of Google's public data APIs, and those of us using Cocoa and Cocoa Touch are directed to the open-source [Google APIs Objective-C Client](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-objectivec-client/) for implementation help.\nIt was good for what it was in 2011, but that was before Swift, modern Objective-C, CocoaPods, and even Automatic Reference Counting! Some things in life age well; that library is not one of them. And Google hasn't helped by basically ignoring their client library in these ways.\nThat's why I decided I would try something new. Something that would actually utilize current technologies. Something that would be actually nice for developers to use.\nI couldn't find what I was looking for, so I decided to build it myself.\nThis library is still in its early stages, but I'm excited for what this library could become!",
