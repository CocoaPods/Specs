  "description": "PannablePickerView lets the user select a numeric value moving its finger up and down inside the control.\n\nBuilt as a better way of handling value selection from a finite range (than UISlider and other alternatives), you can embed it to a full screen app, inline on a TableView or as a UITextField's inputView substitution! (read: awesome in-app custom keyboard). Check out the example project for more.\n\nCustomizable, you can change sizes, colors, units, prefix/suffix and more.",
