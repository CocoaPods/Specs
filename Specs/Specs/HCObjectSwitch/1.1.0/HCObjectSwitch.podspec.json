  "description": "                   Objective-C's switch statements only work on primitive types that are constant at compile time.\n                   However, many Objective-C APIs expect the developer to determine their behaviour based on identifiers passed in as NSString.\n                   To deal with this, HCObjectSwitch adds a simple syntax that is very similar to the native switch statement.\n                   In order to avoid clashing with the native syntax, all keywords start with a capital letter.\n",
