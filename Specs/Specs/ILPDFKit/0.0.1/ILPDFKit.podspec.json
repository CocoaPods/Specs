  "description": "                   \n                   ILPDFKit is a toolkit for working the PDF documents containing\n                   AcroForms. It is continually expanding in features to conform \n                   to a larger part of the PDF specification. \n                   The basic applications for this software are:\n                    * Parse PDF AcroForms, extracting their values and properties.\n                    * Present a PDF with AcroForms in a view controller.\n                    * Allow the user to interact with the document and fill out the forms.\n                    * Save the changes to disk, or push to a webservice.\n",
