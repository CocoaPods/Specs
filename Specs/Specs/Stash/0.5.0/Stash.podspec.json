  "description": "Stash is a key/value store for temporarily persisting objects, such as network responses (images etc), or expensive to reproduce values.\n`Stash` is a simple object that wraps `Memory` (a fast in memory store) and `Disk` (a slower, file system backed store).\n`Memory` will automatically clear itself when your app receives a memory warning.\n`Disk` will persist items until you manually remove items, or automatically using limits.\nThe caches will accept any object that conforms to `NSCoding`, although I'm open to considering a different encoding.\nThe caches primary API's are synchronous, although there are asynchronous wrappers around most of them.",
