We are not there yet, but the intention is to replace your occurrence of NSDate with JHDate and get the same functionality plus lots of local date/calendar/time zone/formatter goodies. Thus offering date functions with a flexibility that I was looking for when creating this library:\n\n- Use the object as an NSDate. I.e. as an absolute time.\n- Contains a date (NSDate), a calendar (NSCalendar), a locale (NSLocale) and a timeZone (NSTimeZone) property\n- Offers many NSDate & NSDateComponent vars & methods\n- Initialise a date with any combination of components\n- Use default values for initialisation if desired\n- Calendar & time zone can be changed, properties change along\n- Default date is `NSDate()`\n- Default calendar is `NSCalendar.currentCalendar()`\n- Default time zone is `NSTimeZone.localTimeZone()`\n- Implements the Equatable & Comparable protocols betwen dates with operators. E.g. `==, !=, <, >, <=, >=`\n- implements date addition and subtraction operators with date components. E.g. `date + 2.days`\n- JHDate is immutable, so thread safe. It contains a constructor to easily create new ``JHDate`` occurrences with some properties adjusted.",
