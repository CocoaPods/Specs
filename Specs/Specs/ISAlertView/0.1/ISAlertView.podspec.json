  "description": "                    The addSubview is not available in UIAlertView in iOS7 any more. The view hierarchy for this class is \n                    private and must not be modified.\n                    As a solution, this class creates an iOS7-style dialog which you can extend with any UIViews or buttons. \n                    The animations and the looks are copied too and no images or other resources are needed.\n",
