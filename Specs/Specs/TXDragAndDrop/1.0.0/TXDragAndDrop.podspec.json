  "description": "# TXDragAndDrop\n\n## Usage\n\nCall ```setDraggingEnabled:``` to make a UIView draggable.\n\nYou can restrict the dragging area throught ```setDraggingEdgeInsets:```.\n\nAs Apple API docs said:\n\nPositive values cause the frame to be inset (or shrunk) by the specified amount. Negative values cause the frame to be outset (or expanded) by the specified amount.\n\nSo, if you want to make UIView draggable to the left, restricting top and bottom, you can set your UIEdgeInsets as:\n\n```\n[self.myview setDraggingEdgeInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0.f, -self.myview.frame.size.width, 0.f, 0.f)];\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n```\n- (void)setDraggingEnabled:(BOOL)draggingEnabled;\n- (BOOL)isDraggingEnabled;\n\n- (void)setDraggingEdgeInsets:(UIEdgeInsets)edgeInsets;\n- (UIEdgeInsets)draggingEdgeInsets;\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nTXDragAndDrop is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install\nit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod \"TXDragAndDrop\"\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Toshiro Sugii\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
