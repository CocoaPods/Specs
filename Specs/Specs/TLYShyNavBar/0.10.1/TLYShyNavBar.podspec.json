  "description": "# Purpose\n\nThe purpose of writing this was to provide a super simple way to add the expansion/contraction UINavigationBar functionality, like the one found in facebook and instagram.\n\nIt literally takes a single liner to get started and have your navigation bar expand/shrink based on the UIScrollView subclass that you attach to the designated object.\n\nIn addition to the support for UINavigationBar, it also allows you to assign an extension view that will be managed for you, and that extension view is shown right below the navigation bar, and will expand/contract as well!\n\nThe component has been carefully written, battle tested, and has more fine grain customization, like the tolerance range you want to hold off the expansion/contraction before applying the effect.\n\nPlease read all about this component in the [github repo readme file](https://github.com/telly/TLYShyNavBar/blob/master/README.md).",
