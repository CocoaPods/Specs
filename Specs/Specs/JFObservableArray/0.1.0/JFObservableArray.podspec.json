  "description": "                        `NSMutableArray` is not KVO-compliant, meaning that you cannot observe changes to the underlying structure of the array. `JFObservableArray` adds KVO-compliance to `NSMutableArray`, informing clients of inserted, replaced, and removed objects in the array. This is useful, for example, in cases where you might need to bind a view in the UI to a list of objects (e.g., `UITableView`).\n",
