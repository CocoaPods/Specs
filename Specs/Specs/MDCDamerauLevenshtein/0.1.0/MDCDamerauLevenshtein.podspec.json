  "description": "                   MDCDamerauLevenshtein includes two algorithms for calculating\n                   the edit distance between NSString objects:\n\n                   1. Levenshtein distance calculates the number of insertions,\n                      deletions, and substitions necessary in order to convert one\n                      string into the other.\n                   2. Damerau-Levenshtein improves upon Levenshtein to include the\n                      transposition of two adjacent characters. Damerau states that\n                      some combination of the four operations make up for 80% of all\n                      human spelling errors.\n\n                   Potential applications for this library:\n\n                   - Don't just use `-[NSString compare:options:]` to filter search results,\n                     display terms with small edit distances.\n                   - ...and many more!\n",
