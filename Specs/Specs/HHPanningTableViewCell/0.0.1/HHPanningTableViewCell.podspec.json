  "description": "                   HHPanningTableViewCell is a UITableViewCell implementing \"swipe to reveal\" a drawer view. Such a view typically holds action buttons applying to the current row.\n\nThis behavior is seen in a number of iOS applications. To my knowledge the idea was pioneered by Loren Brichter for Tweetie (aka Twitter for iPhone).\n\nThe HHPanningTableViewCell implementation was written for the [ACTPrinter 4.0 application](https://itunes.apple.com/app/actprinter-virtual-printer/id296083171?mt=8).\nThe code presented here is identical to the one used in the shipped product.\n",
