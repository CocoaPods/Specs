  "description": "    Hprose is a High Performance Remote Object Service Engine.\n\n    It is a modern, lightweight, cross-language, cross-platform, object-oriented, high performance, remote dynamic communication middleware. It is not only easy to use, but powerful. You just need a little time to learn, then you can use it to easily construct cross language cross platform distributed application system.\n\n    Hprose supports many programming languages, for example:\n\n    * AAuto Quicker\n    * ActionScript\n    * ASP\n    * C++\n    * Dart\n    * Delphi/Free Pascal\n    * dotNET(C#, Visual Basic...)\n    * Golang\n    * Java\n    * JavaScript\n    * Node.js\n    * Objective-C\n    * Perl\n    * PHP\n    * Python\n    * Ruby\n    * ...\n\n    Through Hprose, You can conveniently and efficiently intercommunicate between those programming languages.\n\n    This project is the implementation of Hprose for Objective-C.\n",
