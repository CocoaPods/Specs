  "description": "Among other crazy features, iOS 7 enables users to have automatic updates for their apps, wiping away the infamous App Store badge. This is really convenient both for users and developers, but it comes with a couple of downsides:\n\n* users are not aware about the changes introduced in the latest update, unless they explicitly open the App Store page to check the release notes;\n* developers who spend their time working on well-written release notes lose their chance to inform and communicate with their users.\n\n## So what?\nTWSReleaseNotesView is a simple way to address those issues. It comes with a straightforward API which enables developers to show in-app release notes with a fully customizable popup view.",
