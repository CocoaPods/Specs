  "description": "    Rationale, in 3 simple claims:\n\n    1. There are 3 types of code:\n\n        * Algorithmic / data structure-heavy code (e.g. “create an empty array with the given capacity, iterate over the input collection, perform a test on each element, add the elements passing the test to the output array”)\n\n        * API-heavy code (e.g. “get a file manager, ask for the properties of the given resources, check for errors”)\n\n        * Domain logic (e.g. “ignore missing files”)\n\n    2. It's a bad idea to mix these types of code in a single method.\n\n    3. So when you find yourself writing multiple lines of collection fiddling code and multiple lines of API interaction/domain logic code in the same method, you should extract the algorithmic parts into a separate helper method.\n\n    ATExpressiveCollections is a bunch of algorithmic helpers extracted from my apps over a long period of time.\n",
