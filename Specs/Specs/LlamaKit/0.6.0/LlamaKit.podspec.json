  "description": "Collection of must-have functional tools. Trying to be as lightweight as possible, hopefully providing a simple foundation that more advanced systems can build on. LlamaKit is very Cocoa-focused. It is designed to work with common Cocoa paradigms, use names that are understandable to Cocoa devs, integrate with Cocoa tools like GCD, and in general strive for a low-to-modest learning curve for devs familiar with ObjC and Swift rather than Haskell and ML.",
