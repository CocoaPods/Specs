  "description": "XXTEA is a fast and secure encryption algorithm. This is a XXTEA library for Objective-C.\n\nIt is different from the original XXTEA encryption algorithm. It encrypts and decrypts NSData instead of 32bit integer array, and the key is also the NSData.\n\nIn addition to providing the API of NSData encryption and decryption, it also provides some methods to handle NSString and Base64 encode.",
