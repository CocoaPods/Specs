  "description": "  This is a glue library.\n\n  * It uses [PLCrashReporter](https://code.google.com/p/plcrashreporter/) to generate crash log.\n  * It uses [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaLumberjack) and [NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger) to log everything to a file and NSLoggerViewer.\n  * When a crash occurred, next time you start the app, it'll use [ssziparcive](https://github.com/soffes/ssziparchive) to zip them all and call the block you set with the path of the zip file.\n\n  I didn't expose all the properties of log and crash libraries. You can modify them in file ```NCCWL.m``` to fit your need.\n",
