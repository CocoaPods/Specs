  "description": "This is a glue library. \n\n* It uses [PLCrashReporter](https://code.google.com/p/plcrashreporter/) to generate crash log. \n* It uses [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaLumberjack) and [NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger) to log everything to a file and NSLoggerViewer.\n* When a crash occurred, next time you start the app, it'll use [ssziparcive](https://github.com/soffes/ssziparchive) to zip them all and call the block you set with the path of the zip file.\n\nI didn't expose all the properties of log and crash libraries. You can modify them in file ```NCCWL.m``` to fit your need.",
