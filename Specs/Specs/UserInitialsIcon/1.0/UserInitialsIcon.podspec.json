  "description": "                       A user/'s initials are generated by taking the first two words of his/her name and combining the first letter of each. If the user only has one word in his/her name, there will only be one letter in the initials. Text color is white, background color is chosen from one of 12 options, determined by the hash of the string. Images generated are square, but it is recommended to place them in a circular frame.\n\n",
