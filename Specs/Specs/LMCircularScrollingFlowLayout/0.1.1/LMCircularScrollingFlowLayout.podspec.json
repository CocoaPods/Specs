  "description": "LMCircularScrollingFlowLayout is a UICollectionViewFlowLayout subclass that provides circular (wrapped, infinite) scrolling behavior in a UICollectionView.\n\nJust use in place of UICollectionViewFlowLayout when setting the layout on your collection views. You can select it as the UICollectionViewFlowLayout subclass in interface builder.\n\nWorks fine with all the standard flow layout features, including multiple sections and multiple lines in a section. Works well with scrollview paging enabled or disabled.\n\n\nNOTE: This layout hasn't been tested with some of the new auto-cell sizing features included with iOS 8.0 yet. If you try it out, I'd like to hear if it works or not.\n",
