Ideal for creating\n                   App Previews or other screencasts where it is crucial to show touch\n                   gestures. Not intended for production use.\n\n                   Originally built to preview The Converted, check the [The Converted\n                   website](http://ideon.co/theconverted?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=smudgeKit)\n                   for an example.\n",
