  "description": "Performs a component-wise comparison of colors for equality.\n\nThis allows for the comparison of colors that are saved to disk (via NSKeyedArchiver for example) and loaded again.  The float serialization is imprecise so this bins them with the precision of 1/255 for each channel.",
