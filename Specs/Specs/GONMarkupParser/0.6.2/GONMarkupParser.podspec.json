  "description": "\t\t\t\t\t\tCreating rich text under iOS can be cumbersome, needing a lot of code.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe main goal of GONMarkupParser is to provide an easy to use syntax, near XML/HTML, but more flexible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome others projects exists, allowing you to build NSAttributedString from HTML, but my main goal here was to focus on text semantic. In fact, the parser will detect registered markup and apply style on text.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe purpose of this was to be able to generate different outputs from the same input string, without editing its content, but editing the markups style.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGONMarkupParser is not an out of the box solution to parse HTML files.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tARC only\n",
