  "description": "PTHotKeysLib has served us well for many years, but as I was upgrading my company's applications to run natively in 64 bit I was running into issues. The original code itself used many deprecated methods, 32 bit integer types, etc. As I fixed those issues, my OCD started to get the best of me and I started reformatting and rewriting portions of the code using modern Objective-C practices and paradigms.",
