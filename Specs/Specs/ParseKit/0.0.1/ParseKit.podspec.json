  "description": "\n    ParseKit is a Mac OS X Framework written by Todd Ditchendorf in\n    Objective-C 2.0 and released under the Apache Open Source License\n    Version 2.0. ParseKit is suitable for use on Mac OS X Leopard,\n    Snow Leopard or iOS. ParseKit is an Objective-C implementation\n    of the tools described in Building Parsers with Java by Steven\n    John Metsker.\n\n    ParseKit includes additional features beyond the\n    designs from the book and also some changes to match common\n    Cocoa/Objective-C conventions. These changes are relatively superficial,\n    however, and Metsker’s book is the best documentation available\n    for ParseKit.\n  ",
