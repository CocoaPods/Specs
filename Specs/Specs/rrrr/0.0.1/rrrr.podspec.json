  "description": "                   RRRR (usually pronounced R4) is a C-language implementation of the RAPTOR public transit routing algorithm. It is the core routing component of the Bliksem journey planner and passenger information system. The goal of this project is to generate sets of Pareto-optimal itineraries over large geographic areas (e.g. BeNeLux or all of Europe), improving on the resource consumption and complexity of existing more flexible alternatives. The system should eventually support real-time vehicle/trip updates reflected in trip plans and be capable of running directly on a mobile device with no Internet connection.\n",
