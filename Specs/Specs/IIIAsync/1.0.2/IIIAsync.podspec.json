  "description": "                   IIIAsync is a control flow system for managing multiple operations serially or in parallel. It can collect the results of multiple operations, either objects or errors. When all operations finish, you get a completion handler with the results in a structured order, regardless of which order they complete. You can run these operations either on the main queue, on a single background thread pool, or on a multi-threaded background pool. It makes it easier to organize code and obtain results, letting you build powerful higher-order operations that rely on multiple asynchronous calls. IIIAsync is heavily modeled after and inspired by the brilliant async.js library by Caolan McMahon.\n",
