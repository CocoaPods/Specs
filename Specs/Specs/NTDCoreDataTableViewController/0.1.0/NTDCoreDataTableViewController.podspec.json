  "description": "        I was going to code for my second CoreData based Table View Controller. Then it occurred to me that 80% (or even more) of the functionality of two CoreData based Table View Controller are exactly the SAME. So I decided to refactor all those common stuff in a CDTVC into a super class. With my Unit Test covering me and Xcodeâ€™s Refactor, it all went pretty well.\n        Volia! This is it.\n",
