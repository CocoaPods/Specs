  "description": "                   Haxcessibility is, above all, a horrible pun on Mac OS X’s Accessibility framework and its AX prefix. I am shameless.\n\n                   Second to that, Haxcessibility is a use case–driven remote control for Mac apps by Mac apps. It enables hacks like moving and resizing another app’s windows, and there’s loads more that the AX APIs make possible that Haxcessibility could make convenient with a method or two.\n",
