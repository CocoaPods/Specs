Also, when using [CAShow](http://google.com/search?q=Apple+Developer+Audio+Toolbox+Debugging+Reference+CAShow)\n                    I became even more weary of tring to remember all of the various\n                    `OSType` [FourCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FourCC) codes that CoreAudio uses.\n",
