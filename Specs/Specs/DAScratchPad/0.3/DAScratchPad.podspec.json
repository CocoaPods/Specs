  "description": "DAScratchPad is a small UIView subclass that provides a simple drawing interface.  It provides both a painting and airbrushing capability.  You can put this view anywhere in your UI, and your user can draw in it.  You can add UI controls to change drawing color, line width, opacity, select painting or airbrushing, and set airbrush flow and rate.  You can also get the current image from the scratch pad, clear the current image, or replace the current image.\n",
