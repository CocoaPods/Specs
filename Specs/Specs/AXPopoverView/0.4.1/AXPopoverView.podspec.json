The popover view (mostly used as `Label` or `Other`) is a convenient and hommization way for developer to use.\n\n* Think: Why did you write this? What is the focus? What does it do?\n* CocoaPods will be using this to generate tags, and improve search results.\n* Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.\n* Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!",
