  "description": "                       \tSwiftSimplify is a tiny high-performance Swift polyline simplification ported from Simplify.js.\n\t\t\tIt uses a combination of Douglas-Peucker and Radial Distance algorithms. It uses generics, works with Swift 1.2.\n\t\t\tPolyline simplification dramatically reduces the number of points in a polyline while retaining its shape, giving \n\t\t\ta huge performance boost when processing it and also reducing visual noise. For example, it's essential when \t\n\t\t\trendering a 70k-points line chart or a map route in the browser using Canvas or SVG.\n",
