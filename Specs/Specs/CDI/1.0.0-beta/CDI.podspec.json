  "description": "                    Using CDI will reduce the boilerplate code in many classes, increase readability and allow better testing using the mocking technique. CDI has no dependencies to other frameworks, which means you can use any unit testing, mocking or other framework. Code samples are provided for XCTest.\n\n                    The main features are:\n                    * Injection by annotation\n                    * Component auto-wiring\n                    * Easy singleton support\n                    * Manual object binding\n",
