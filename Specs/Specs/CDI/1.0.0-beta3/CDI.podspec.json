  "description": "                    Simple, easy and very powerful way to use context and dependency injection and interception for Objective-C development. CDI is designed to solve some common software development patterns like Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control, Singleton and Interception (an minimalistic AOP approach).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main features are:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t* Injection by annotation\n\t\t\t\t\t* Component auto-wiring\n\t\t\t\t\t* Manual object binding\n\t\t\t\t\t* Singleton by annotation\n\t\t\t\t\t* Interception by annotation\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUsing CDI will reduce the boilerplate code in many classes, increase readability and allow better testing. The intreception functionality will also provide the ability to separate the implementation code by aspects like security, logging and other facets.\n\t\t\t\t\tCDI does not depend on another framework, which means you can use any unit testing, mocking or other framework (see Limitation chapter).\n",
