  "description": "                   A simple, Cocoa-like library useful for programmers writing Objective-C or Swift apps for the Mac that must communicate with external devices through a serial port (most commonly RS-232). ORSSerialPort makes it easy to find the serial ports available on the system, configure serial ports, and send and receive data. It also includes an optional request/response API to simplify structured communication with external devices.\n",
