  "description": "                    `GDIIndexBar` is a component for navigating sections of a `UITableView`. It reproduces the index bar seen in the Contacts app on iOS and styled to match both iOS6 and iOS7 by default. `GDIIndexBar` can also be customized through the appearance protocol or by subclassing. \n\n                    `GDIIndexBar` behaves by automatically sizing and positioning itself on the right side of the provided `UITableView`. Subclasses can alter this by overriding the `layoutSubviews` method of the `GDIIndexBar`. `GDIIndexBar` provides automatic vertical adjustments for the index bar by setting a `GDIIndexBarAlignment` value. \n\n                    `GDIIndexBar` is supports being added directly to a `UITableView` as a child subview, or can exist in a different view than the table while still positioning automatically. *NOTE:* In order to correctly receive touch events as a subview of a `UITableView`, the `delaysContentTouches` property is automatically set to `NO`.\n",
