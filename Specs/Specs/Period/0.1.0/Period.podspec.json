  "description": "The `Period` class represents a period of time after an NSDate object.\nIt is in absolute time so it has no references to calendrical properties.\nVarious operations are implemented e.g.:\n- check whether an NSDate instance lies within a Period instance.\n- check whether an Period instance lies within a Period instance.\n- check whether an Period instance overlaps a Period instance.\n- check whether an Period instance is earlier/later than a Period instance without overlap (< or > operators).\n- check whether an Period instance is earlier/later than or overlaps than a Period instance (<= or >= operators).\n- implements Equatable & Comparable protocols.",
