  "description": "                   SFPSDWriter is an Objective-C library for writing PSD files. Here at Shiny Frog we needed a way to write **multilayer** **PSDs** with **groups** and this library is the result after days of headaches.\n\n                   It features:\n\n                   * Multilayer PSD creation\n                   * Grouping of layers\n                   * Unicode layer name support\n                   * Some layer configurations (like the blend mode of the layer)\n                   * ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)\n\n                   What SFPSDWriter **NOT** features:\n\n                   * Ability to read PSD files\n",
