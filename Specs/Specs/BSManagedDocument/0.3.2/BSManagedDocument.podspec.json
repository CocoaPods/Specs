  "description": "A document class that mimics `UIManagedDocument` to support Core Data in all its modern glory:\n\n  *   Saves to a file package.\n  *   On 10.7+, asynchronous saving is supported. We set up a parent/child pair of contexts; the parent saves on its own thread.\n  *   Full support for concurrent document opening too.\n  *   Subclasses can hook in to manage additional content inside the package.\n  *   A hook is also provided at the best time to set metadata for the store.\n  *   New docs have the bundle bit set on them. It means that if the doc gets transferred to a Mac without your app installed, with the bundle bit still intact, it will still appear in the Finder as a file package rather than a folder.\n  *   If the document moves on disk, Core Data is kept informed of the new location.\n  *   If multiple validation errors occur during saving, the presented error is adjusted to make debugging a little easier.\n  *   And of course, full support for Autosave-In-Place and Versions.\n  ",
