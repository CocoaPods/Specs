The is useful if you are trying to port JavaScript libraries to Objective-C or want a more familiar testing syntax.\n\n                    I wrote this to help me port Underscore.js to Objective-C in [_.m](https://github.com/kmalakoff/_.m) and to make Objective-C a little more script in [Subjective-Script](https://github.com/kmalakoff/SubjectiveScript.m) so you will find some good examples in those project's tests.\n",
