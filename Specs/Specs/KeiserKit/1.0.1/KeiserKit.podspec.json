  "description": "Objective-C Library for reading data from the Keiser M3i Exercise Bike using CoreBluetooth for iOS.\n\nThis library provides scanning and bike simulation (for n bikes), through a few methods that provide all the necessary functionality to start working with the bikes.\nNOTE: This library will not work in the background unfortunately. The M3i does not provide service/characteristic data and cannot be connected to, iOS only allows you to see a device's advertising data once in the background and has to search for a specific list of services/characteristics or connect to a device to get a stream of data.",
