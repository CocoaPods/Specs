  "description": "\tRNCachingURLProtocol is a simple shim for the HTTP protocol (that’s not nearly as scary as it sounds). Anytime a URL is downloaded, the response is cached to disk. Anytime a URL is requested, if we’re online then things proceed normally. If we’re offline, then we retrieve the cached version.\n",
