It depends on the following Apple frameworks, which should already be included with most Xcode templates:\n\n                  * Foundation.framework\n                  * UIKit.framework\n                  * CoreGraphics.framework\n                  * QuartzCore.framework\n\n                  You will need LLVM 3.0 or later in order to build Waver.\n\n",
