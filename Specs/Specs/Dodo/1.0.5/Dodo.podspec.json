It is useful for showing short messages to the user, something like: \"Message sent\", \"Note saved\", \"No Internet connection\".\n\n                   * Dodo includes styles for success, info, warning and error type messages.\n                   * The bar can have buttons with custom tap handlers.\n                   * Bar styles can be customized.\n                   * You can provide custom animations for showing and hiding the bar or use one of the default animation presets.\n",
