  "description": "An easy, customizable and soft banner notification for iOS applications.\nAWBanner library provides an easy to use class to show a banner view on the screen ( wherever you want, you can specify the Y origin ).\nThe banner moves from the Y origin ( default 0, but you can change it üëç) and stays there until the duration you choose elapse ( Personally I choose in general 2.5s ).\nTo dismiss the banner before the time elapse, the user can tap it.",
