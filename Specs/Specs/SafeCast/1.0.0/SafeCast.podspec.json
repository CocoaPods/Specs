  "description": "                  * Cast in Objective-C, not in C\n                  * Be Safe\n                  * Be Concice\n                  \n                  Objective-C is C, and C can be perilous. Don't blindly cast objects. Stick to high-level language features, and write more readable code.\n                  \n                  Quite simply, you can do things like this:\n                  \n                  ```\n                  NSMutableArray *mArray = [NSMutableArray safe_cast:array];\n                  // `mArray` is `nil` if `array` is not a mutable array, and is `array` if it is mutable.\n                  ```\n                  \n                  Or only perform a selector if the target responds to it without an explicit check:\n                  \n                  ```\n                  [array safe_makeObjectsSafelyPerformSelector:@selector(method)];\n                  ```\n                  \n                  Or enumerate with a block on objects that are of a specific kind:\n                  \n                  ```\n                  [array safe_enumerateObjectsOfKind:[MyObject class]\n                                          usingBlock:^(MyObject *obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {\n                                              [obj setNumber:@3];\n                                          }];\n                  ```\n                  \n                  And lots of other similar methods on standard collections.\n",
