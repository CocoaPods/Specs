  "description": "A GMSMapView subclass which clusters groups of GMSMarkers and replaces them with single GMSMarkers, enabling the developer to generate custom UIImages for each cluster on the fly. It also includes a GMSMapView subclass, HSMapView, which does not cluster GMSMarkers, but instead keeps track of the GMSMarkers on the map internally, eliminating the need to store them elsewhere. HSMapView aims to provide a clean map interface to work with the Google Maps for iOS SDK.",
