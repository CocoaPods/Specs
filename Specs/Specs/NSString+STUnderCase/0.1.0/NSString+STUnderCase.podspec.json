Since it's mostly working with keys / attribute\n                       names, this isn't that much of an issue since they're usually simple ASCII.\n\n                       ## why\n\n                       At Social Tables, our app does a fair bit of talking to an API and marshaling\n                       data back and forth, with some custom logic involved. It became very useful\n                       for marshaling and introspection to be able to turn an `attribute_name` into\n                       an `attributeName`.\n\n                       ## how\n\n                       http://walkingsmarts.com/camelcasing-and-underscoring-strings-in-objectivec/\n                       provided the basis for our code.\n",
