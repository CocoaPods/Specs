  "description": "A diff algorithm implementend in pure Swift based on Paul Heckel's paper: \"A technique for isolating differences between files\".\nIt's a very fast algorithm with linear complexity in both time and space. \nGiven two different arrays, A and B, what steps A has to make to become B?\nPHDiff can answer that by calculating the needed Inserts, Deletes, Moves and Updates!\nWorks great with UITableView and UICollectionView and can be used right on the main queue.",
