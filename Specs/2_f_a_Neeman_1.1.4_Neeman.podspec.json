  "description": "The idea behind Neeman is to help you easily create a usable Hibrid app from an existing web app. \nIt does this without getting in your way of adding additional native functionality. Try it out with your web app embeded in a native navigation stack. \nYou can then see if you need to reimplement certain features natively. The best way to save development time and still maintain a beautify user experience \nis to keep your content rendered with HTML and implement your navigation natively.\n\n## Getting Started\n1. Create an Xcode project with the template best suiting your app.\n2. Make one of your view controllers a WebViewController.\n3. Set the **User Defined Runtime Attribute** `rootURLString` to the URL you which to display.",
