  "description": "BRPDFImage is a very small extension of UIImage that allows you to use PDF \nartwork anywhere a UIImage is needed. The PDF format can be thought of as \njust another vector art file format, and in fact any vector art editing \nprogram worth a lick will support saving PDF files.\n\nUsing PDF artwork can provide significant app size savings as a single\nvector PDF file can be used on all device resolutions without any loss of\nfidelity. The drawing can be tinted as well, for example to match an\nestablished color theme.",
