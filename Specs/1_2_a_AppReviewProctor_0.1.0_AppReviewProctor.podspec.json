  "description": "Apple provides SKStoreReviewController to provide SDK support for user app reviews.  Whether or not this will actually display an app review is governed by App Store Policy, and Apple leaves it up to the developer to use SKStoreReviewController \"when it makes sense in the user experience flow of your app.\"  App Review Proctor provides a wrapper around SKStoreReviewController that supports various bookkeeping operations to help decide when it makes sense to request a review be displayed in your app.  If a user's device does not support SKStoreReviewController, an UIAlertController-based review interface is provided.",
