  "description": "FlexNetworking is a modern, convenient, Codable-optimized, Rx-enabled networking library that is built specifically for apps that make safe calls to APIs while avoiding boilerplate. We, the developers, have been using it in production since the very first version for networking-heavy client apps and constantly evolving it to fit what we do better. So far, it has been used in three social networking apps and two team-based content creation apps.",
