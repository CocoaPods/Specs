  "description": "\n      OCMockito is an Objective-C implementation of Mockito, supporting creation, \n      verification and stubbing of mock objects.\n\n      Key differences from other mocking frameworks:\n\n      * Mock objects are always \"nice,\" recording their calls instead of \n        throwing exceptions about unspecified invocations. This makes tests less fragile.\n      * No expect-run-verify, making tests more readable. Mock objects \n        record their calls, then you verify the methods you want.\n      * Verification failures are reported as unit test failures, \n        identifying specific lines instead of throwing exceptions. This makes \n        it easier to identify failures.\n  ",
