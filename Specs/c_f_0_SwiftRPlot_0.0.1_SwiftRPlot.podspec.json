  "summary": "A swift module for real-time time series data visualization on macOS/iOS",
  "description": "Plotting time series data such as analog signals in real-time can be difficult. Charting solutions\n  currently available are not fine-tuned for real-time plots and can be CPU/RAM intensive so I've decided to address this.\n\n  This project was partly inspired from the tiredness of having 3rd party library fails after OS updates.\n  Thus, the project will be as lightweight as possible and purely Swift & Cocoa(Touch) based to minimalize problems & update time when new OS arrives.",
