  "description": "A Swift representation of money / monetary amounts and ISO 4217 currency designations. Supports manipulation\nand combination of monetary amounts of a single or multiple currency. Handles minor units (the exponent, e.g. cents for USD)\nfor each currency as specified in the ISO 4217 standard. Simple manipulation includes consolidating / combining \namounts. For example with MonetaryAmount, GBP10.50 + USD5.70 + GBP6.50 + USD8.10 consolidated would result in \nGBP17.00 and USD13.80. MonetaryAmount does not do any FX or conversion of currencies, it keeps each individual \ncurrency subtotal separate.",
