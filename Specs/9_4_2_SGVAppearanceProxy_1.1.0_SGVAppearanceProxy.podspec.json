  "description": "                      UIAppearance performs slow under iOS7 because of some internal changes: certain setter methods (those with axis values or those with more than one argument end up calling an expensive method_exchageImplementations() function. \n                      This proxy wraps around original appearance proxy and uses the message forwarding mechanism of Objective-C to translate the affected method calls into methods with a single argument, and then passes them along to the original proxy, thus mitigating the problem.\n",
