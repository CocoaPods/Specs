  "description": "For those that have a preference to do UI code in iOS programatically rather than using Interface Builder, NSLayoutConstraints can take up a lot of lines of code. They can also be quite difficult to read and make sense of. The goal of this is to restrict the length required to express a layout constraint. It also makes the constraint easier to ready. This library is aimed for Swift use. It won't be as pleasent in Objective C, due to the builder chaining of functions.",
