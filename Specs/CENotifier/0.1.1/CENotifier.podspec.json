  "description": "                   CENotifier will take care of queueing up the notifications and only displaying them if they will fit on the screen without overlapping with other notification views already being displayed.\n\n                   Tapping on the main part of a notification view will dismiss the view immediately and send a delegate message to let you know the view was tapped.\n\n                   If the user taps the image part of the notification, it acts as a \"cancel\" action and a separate delegate message is sent in that case.\n",
