  "description": "ABKeyboardAccessory makes it easier to determine when a keyboard is being shown/dismissed for UITextViews and UITextFields. ABKeyboardAccessory subclasses UIView, and is implemented by setting the ABKeyboardView as the 'inputAccessory' for the desired UITextView/UITextField. ABKeyboardAccesoryDelegate provides methods which relay information about the current frame of the ABKeyboardAccessory view, where one can adjust UI depending on the keyboard appearance.",
