  "description": "MBQuickType is designed to easily present a list of options to the user when entering text. The inspiration for MBQuickType came when I was creating an app that required emails to be entered. Why should users have to add their email domain, when almost everyone has a G-Mail account. Why can't they tap a button and have \"@gmail.com\" or \"gmail.com\" appended to their text? Well, now it's easily possible",
