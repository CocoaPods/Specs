  "description": "Lookback is a tool and library for user experience testing\nthat you can integrate into your app. Lookback records the\niOS screen, the front-facing camera, microphone, metadata,\ntouches and active views, and uploads it all in\nnear-realtime to lookback.io where you can study and dive\ninto the data. Example use cases:\n\n* User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your\ntesting lab to record both the screen and your tester's\nreactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.\n* Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of\nusing your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring\nproblems.\n* Quality assurance. Record videos of found bugs, complete\nwith a trace of how the tester reached it.\n\nThis version of Lookback is safe to use on the Apple AppStore,\nbut this safety has heavy performance penalties. If you just\nwant to use Lookback for video bug reports and similar\ninternally while developing your app, consider using\nLookback HD (the \"Lookback\" pod).\n\nSee some more examples over at http://lookback.io/examples.",
