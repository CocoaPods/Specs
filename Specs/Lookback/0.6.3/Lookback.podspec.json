  "description": "                    Lookback is a tool and library for user experience testing\n                    that you can integrate into your app. Lookback records the\n                    iOS screen, the front-facing camera, microphone, metadata,\n                    touches and active views, and uploads it all in\n                    near-realtime to lookback.io where you can study and dive\n                    into the data. Example use cases:\n\n                  * User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your\n                    testing lab to record both the screen and your tester's\n                    reactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.\n                  * Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of\n                    using your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring\n                    problems.\n                  * Quality assurance. Record videos of found bugs, complete\n                    with a trace of how the tester reached it.\n                    \n                  Use this version of Lookback in versions of your app that you\n                  debug with or submit to testers, but not to Appstore: your app\n                  will be rejected. See the pod LookbackSafe for a version you\n                  can use in the AppStore.\n\n                  See some more examples over at http://lookback.io/examples.\n\n",
