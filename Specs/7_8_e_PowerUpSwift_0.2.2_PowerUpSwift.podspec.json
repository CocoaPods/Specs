  "description": "Apple doesn't provide some useful utilities to make our lives easier. This might be for a (good) reason. My experience in iOS Development was brutally painful. It's usually difficult to implement a simple basic feature that you can easily do in Android built-in, so you end up doing a couple more hacks. I created this library to save time, to be more productive, and to be DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).",
