  "summary": "A library for iOS audio which acts as a watchdog for unsafe activity on the audio thread.",
  "description": "This library for iOS acts as a watchdog for activities on the Core Audio thread that are considered unsafe:\n\n1. Taking locks\n2. Allocating memory\n3. Using Objective-C\n4. File or network IO\n\nIt works by overriding a number of system functions, including malloc, free, objc_storeStrong, objc_msgSend (for 64-bit devices and the 64-bit simulator only, for now), pthread_mutex_lock and objc_sync_enter, read, write, etc. When a call is intercepted, a warning is printed to the console. You can also put a breakpoint on AERealtimeWatchdogUnsafeActivityWarning.\n\nIt won’t catch everything, and it won’t catch anything in Apple’s own system code, but it’ll catch some locks, some memory allocation, all Objective-C use (but not Swift), all object retains, and some common IO tasks, in your code and that of any static libraries you’re using.",
