  "description": "                   The Airbrake iOS Notifier is designed to give developers instant notification of problems that occur in their apps. With just a few lines of code and a few extra files in your project, your app will automatically phone home whenever a crash or exception is encountered. These reports go straight to Airbrake where you can see information like backtrace, device type, app version, and more.\n",
