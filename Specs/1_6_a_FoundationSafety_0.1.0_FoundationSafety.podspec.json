  "description": "  \n  Foundation Safety\n=========\n\nA collection of categories designed to make working with Foundation collections safer.\n\nWho here hasn't caused a crash in production because of an out of bounds exception on an NSArray, or a valueForUndefinedKey for an NSDictionary? I'm not a huge fan of constantly having to type\n\n```objc\nif (theIndexIWantToAccess < theArrayImUsing.count) {\n    //Now I'm safe\n} else {\n    //I would have crashed here\n}\n```\n\nCall me lazy, be a hater, just know that these categories aren't meant to replace writing correct code. These categories are predicated on the fact that *we make mistakes* and these mistakes should be learned from while not crashing production apps.\n\n*This means that some remote logging should probably be set up so that we can actually learn from the times these categories prevent a crash.*\n\nThese categories currently contain safety methods for:\n- NSArray / NSMutableArray\n- NSDictionary / NSMutableDictionary\n- NSObject (just to support the items above)\n\nInstallation\n--------------\n\nIf I've done my job and submitted this to Cocoapods, you should just be able to install with:\n\n```sh\npod install FoundationSafety\n```\n\notherwise there's always submodules :)\n\nLicense\n----\n\nMIT\n\n\n**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**\n",
