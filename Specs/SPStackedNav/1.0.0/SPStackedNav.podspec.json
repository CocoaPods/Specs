  "description": "    SPStackedNavigationController is a UINavigationController drop-in replacement,\n    which represents its content in stacks of panes, rather than one at a time.\n    This interface trend was started by Loren Brichter in Tweetie for iPad, and\n    has spread to many apps in many variations since.\n\n    There are two main advantages to this approach:\n\n    * You can display two pieces of main content at once, allowing you to\n      navigate in one while using content in the other.\n    * Navigation is direct instead of indirect, which is faster and more\n      intuitive to use. You actually grab the UI and *pull* it to where you want\n      it. In contrast, a standard navigation controller requires you to find and\n      tap a button with an abstract \"back\" concept.\n\n    The main drawback is that you should no longer use horizontal gestures, as\n    they will interfere with navigation, or the other way around.\n",
