  "description": "                   When a view looks a bit out of place, but you can't be tell why, use PTLViewDebugger to figure it out.  Using [`recursiveDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2239/_index.html) helps a bit, but it can be hard to find the view you were looking for in the resulting wall of text.  Supplement it with `ptl_showDebugBorder` and `ptl_recursiveDescription` to visually map a view's border color to it's description.\n",
