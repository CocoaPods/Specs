  "description": "CocoaMarkdown aims to solve two primary problems better than existing libraries:\nMore flexibility. CocoaMarkdown allows you to define custom parsing hooks or even traverse the Markdown AST using the low-level API.\nEfficient NSAttributedString creation for easy rendering on iOS and OS X. Most existing libraries just generate HTML from the Markdown, which is not a convenient representation to work with in native apps.",
