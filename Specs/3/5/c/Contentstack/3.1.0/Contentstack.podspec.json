It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content. \n\nIn a world where content is consumed via countless channels and form factors across mobile, web and IoT, Built.io Contentstack reimagines content management by decoupling code from content. Business users manage content – no training or development required. Developers can create cross-platform apps and take advantage of a headless CMS that delivers content through APIs. With an architecture that’s extensible – but without the bloat of legacy CMS – Built.io Contentstack cuts down on infrastructure, maintenance, cost and complexity.",
