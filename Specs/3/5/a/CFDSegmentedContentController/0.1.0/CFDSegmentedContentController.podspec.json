  "description": "CFDSegmentedContentController is an auxiliary View Controller class that may be used\nin your storyboards to change content based on a Segmented Control in the Navigation\nBar, similar to a Tab Bar Controller. The purpose of this class is to get around the\nlimitation of a single Embed Segue for Container Views in IB. This Pod is mostly provided\nas a way to publish an experiment, but in any case, it works and is helpful in solving\nthe problem at hand when you want to stay in Storyboard-land.",
