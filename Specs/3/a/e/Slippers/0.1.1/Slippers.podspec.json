  "description": "Slippers adds some structure around common networking tasks like refreshing, paging, and json parsing.\n\nSpecifically, it provides:\n- A protocol called Refreshable which requires a `refresh` function\n- A functional implementation of Refreshable\n- A 'meta' refresher class which will accept bunch of refreshables and refresh all of them on command\n- A protocol called Pageable which requires `nextPage` and `fetchPage` functions\n- A functional implementation of Pageable + Refreshable that manages the page number for you\n- An extension to Pageable that can be used with `UITableViewDelegate`s to simplify infinite lists\n- An array extension that allows you to use a simple array to simulate paginated batches of elements\n- A class that makes a single JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder available throughout your project with smart defaults set on them\n- A ID class that you can use transparently for integer server ids which helps enforce type consistency when passed around",
