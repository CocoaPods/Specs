  "summary": "Quantwm is a Data Model access layer, which send ordered notifications",
  "description": "Quantwm is an architecture framework, which enforces a lot of rules to eliminate common sources of variability inside a complex application. View Controllers shall only communicate synchronously with the Model, and Quantwm will schedule the notifications inside the event loop first with a hard-coded priority to update the view hierarchy, then according to property depedency to update view content.\nThe decoupling help building a clean architecture, with a clear contract and context associated to each entity:\n- Source: Writing an event in the model\n- Hard-coded priority processing: Either coordinate and update the view hierarchy, or process the model data.\n- Property dependent processing: Register to Read{A,B} and Write {C}. Is only allowed to Read A and B and Write C.\n- Property dependent sink: Registered view will update their content once all the previous processing has cleanly formatted the data.",
