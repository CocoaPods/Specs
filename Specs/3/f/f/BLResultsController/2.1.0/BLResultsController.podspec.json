  "description": "Contrary to popular belief, BLResultsController is **not** a drop-in replacement for the `NSFetchedResultsController` to be used with Realm. Oh no. It's _better_.\n\nA `ResultsController` takes a `Realm.Results` and divides its objects into sections based on the `sectionNameKeyPath` and the first `sortDescriptor`. It then calculates the relative positions of those objects and generates section indices and `IndexPath`s that are ready to be passed to `UITableView`s and `UICollectionView`s.\n\nBut **no expensive calculations are made on the main thread**. That's right. Everything is done in the background, so your UI will remain as smooth and responsive as always.\n\nAs with `Realm.Results`, the `ResultsController` is a live, auto-updating container that will keep notifying you of changes in the dataset for as long as you hold a strong reference to it. You register to receive those changes by calling `setChangeCallback(_:)` on your controller.\n\nChanges to the underlying dataset are calculated on a background queue, therefore the UI thread is not impacted by the `ResultsController`'s overhead.\n\n**Note**: As with `Realm` itself, the `ResultsController` is **not** thread-safe. You should only call most of its methods from the main thread.\n\n## Features\n\n- [X] Calculates everything on a **background thread**. 🏎\n- [X] No objects are retained, so memory footprint is minimal. 👾\n- [X] Calculates section index titles. 😲\n- [X] Allows for user-initiated search. 🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♂️\n- [X] Most methods return in O(1). 😎\n- [X] Well documented. 🤓\n- [X] Well tested. 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬",
