  "description": "I recently had a need to create a way to access the macOS and iOS keychain from within a Swift-based app I was developing.  Although there are several comprehensive libraries out there for this very purpose, I found that they were fairly complex and involved a lot of code.  I needed something that was small and compact and easy to add to any project, just by dropping in a few files.  I decided to create my own as a cocoa framework and cocoapod that will work in both macOS and iOS Swift-based projects.",
