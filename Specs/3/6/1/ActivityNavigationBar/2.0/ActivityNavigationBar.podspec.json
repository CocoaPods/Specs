  "description": "Activity navigation bar provides a custom navigation bar with a build in\nactivity indicator. The activity indicator is styled like a progress bar,\nbut is intended to be used to indicate indeterminate activity time.\n\nTo achieve this, the activity is started with a 'waitAt' parameter.\nThe activity bar will then animate progress to this point, and stop.\nThen, once our indeterminate activity has finished, we finish the\nactivity indicator.",
