  "description": "AsyncOpKit helps manage asynchronous operations.\n\n* AsyncOperation is a Swift NSOperation subclass that handles\nthe boilerplate necessary for asynchronous NSOperations. Just\noverride main() and don't forget to finish your operation.\n* AsyncOperation also provides a helpful result handler that\nfires on a queue of your choosing (default mainQueue) and lets\nyou provide result value and error.\n* AsyncClosuresOperation is an AsyncOperation subclass that\nlets you manage asynchronous work inside of closures. It's similar\nto NSBlockOperation, but but closures/blocks do not finish until\n    you mark them as complete.",
