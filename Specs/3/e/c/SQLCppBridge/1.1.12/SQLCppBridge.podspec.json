  "description": "The purpose of this framework is to provide the most simplest way of mapping an\n  arbitrary structure of C ++ / STL derived classes on a flat SQL-table. The\n  framework also provides methods for reading and writing (synchronous / asynchronous),\ndelete and edit data both as whole containers and as individual elements of them.\nCurrently SQLite implementation for MacOSX and iOS is used for data storing but you\ncan work adapters further to be compatible with any SQL-like library. In addition,\nall the work on forming SQL statements is made inside the library and does not require\nintervention and any improvements on the outside.",
