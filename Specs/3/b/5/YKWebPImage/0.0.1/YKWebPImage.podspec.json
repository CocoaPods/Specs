  "description": "\t  # YKWebPImage\n\t  Plug and Play WebP Image support for iOS. It's as simple as installing the Pod. Under the hood, this library swizzles the init methods of `UIImage` and adds a lightweight header scan of the image data to check for WebP format, then decodes if a positive match is found.\n"
