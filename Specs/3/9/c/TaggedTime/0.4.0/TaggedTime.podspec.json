  "version": "0.4.0",
  "description": "We often work with types that are far too general or hold far too many values\nthan what is necessary for our domain. Sometimes we just want to\ndifferentiate between two seemingly equivalent values at the type level.\n\nTagged lets us wrap basic types in more specific contexts with ease, and\nTaggedTime provides two completely different types for differentiating\nbetween seconds and millseconds.",
