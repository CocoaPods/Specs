  "description": "A normal UICollectionView has no transition effects when you scroll from one\nitem to another. There are lots of ways to write animations for\nUICollectionView, but using a UICollectionViewLayout subclass is by far the\nsimplest one. And it doesn't break any of your existing code. You can still\nuse your UICollectionView subclass and you don't need to change your\nUICollectionViewCell. Just plug and enjoy.",
