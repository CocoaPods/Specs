  "description": "This is a library written in swift which is intended to make the creation of data entry forms in iOS fast and easy.  I have tried to abstract out all of the\nboiler plate code so that you can focus on what makes your project unique and avoid unnecessary headaches and duplicated code.  It is highly recommended that you read the instructions document included with the example project so that you can understand how this library works and how to use it in your project.",
