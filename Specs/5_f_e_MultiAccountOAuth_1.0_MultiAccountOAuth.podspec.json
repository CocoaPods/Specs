  "description": "While developing [PickedMail - The personal AI Inbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pickedmail/id1244830423?mt=8), we need to support user login to multiple Google accounts simultaneously. However, Google iOS SDK only allows user to sign in to one account at a time. As a result, we developed a framework to allow us to sign in and maintain connection status to multiple Google accounts. This framework is open sourced to help others who struggling through the same problem.",
