  "summary": "A Swift framework with some common extensions and functions",
  "description": "Various extensions and functions. Some are written by me, some are\ncollected online. And some are variations. This framework is supposed\nto give you a faster start with your project by combining some useful\nand often used code. Includes few UI classes extending UILabel as well\nsince extensions for UILabel could not provide this functionality.\n\n - Merged: LocaleKit support. LocaleKit allows a fixed App wide locale to be defined.\n - Merged: NumPad. NumPad for both iPhone and iPad, also with phone style keypad.\n - Merged: MathKit support. Math extensions are now merged to CommonKit.\n - Merged: DateKit support. Extension to Date and general helpers to handle dates in UTC timezone.\n - Merged: DispatchKit. Extensions to DispatchQueue and a simple but powerful backgrounding Task Manager support.\n - Merged: CurrencyKit. Framework helps presenting money.\n - Merged: AttributedStringWrapper by gaoyu/loopeer. I didn't write this, but it's great work, and I didn't want to add it is a dependency.\n - Merged: FontKit. Framework provides support for icon fonts. First one with FontAwesome 5 support :)\n - Merged: PopOverKit. Framework provides support for displaying popover balloons on iPhone and iPad.\n - Merged: PhotoPicker and PhotoPreview",
