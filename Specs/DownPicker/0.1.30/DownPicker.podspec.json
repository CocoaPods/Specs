  "description": "DownPicker is an extremely light-weight class library for creating DropDownList / ComboBox controls for iOS that will behave like their HTML / Android counterparts.\nYou'll only need a standard UITextField and few lines of code.\n\nDownPicker is basically a *control interface wrapper*, meaning that you won't use it as a control - it will use an existing UITextField control instead.\nThis is a good thing, because you'll be able to design, positioning and skin your UITextField like you always do, programmatically or inside a *Storyboard* UI, depending on how you are used to work. You won't change your style, as it will adapt to suit yours.\n\nHowever, if you don't like the *control wrapper* pattern, you can just use it as a *custom control* using the included **UIDownPicker** class. It's entirely up to you (and very easy to install in both scenarios).\n\nDownPicker is released under MIT License.\nInstallation instructions, examples and documentation are available in the included README.md file.",
