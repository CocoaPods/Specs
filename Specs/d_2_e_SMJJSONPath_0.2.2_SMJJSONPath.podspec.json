  "description": "TODO:\n    This implementation is a tight adaptation of Jayway JsonPath. It respects the original structure and naming, as much as possible. The changes are mainly to be more Objective-C stylized (named parameters, use NSError instead of try-catch-exception, etc.).\n\n    This tight adaptation was done for different reasons:\n\n    If I wanted to structure something from my own view, I would have started from scratch, and I wouldn't have done it at all : this is a big bunch of code, tests and reflexion to do, more than I want to give to that.\n    The Jayway JsonPath project have a pretty good and complete implementation (with some cleaning here and there to do, which are already documented by original developers). It's a good reference, from my point of view.\n    I want to facilitate cherry-picking updates from Jayway JsonPath to include them right here.\n    This code is currently based on commit c187488.",
