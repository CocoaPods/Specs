  "description": "TinyCrayon SDK provides tools for adding image layer mask capabilities to your mobile applications.\n\nImage layer mask is a fundamental technique in image manipulations. It allows you to selectively modify the opacity (transparency) of the layer they belong to. This flexibility to define the opacity of different areas of a layer is the basis for more interesting image manipulation techniques such as selective coloring and luminosity masking.\n\nThe current version of TinyCrayon SDK provides the following three tools:\n* Quick Select: Smart and easy to use, you just need to select part of the object and the edge detection algorithm will find the boundary for you.\n* Hair Brush: Smooth and natual looking, paint on the hair/fur of an object and the algorithm will select the hair/fur for you in high quality.\n* Regular Brush: A regular brush tool with the capability to adjust its size, hardness and opacity.",
