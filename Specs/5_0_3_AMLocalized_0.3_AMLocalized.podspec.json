LocalizationSetLanguage(\"language\") // where \"language\" string should match the name of the .strings file -> language.strings\n2. AMLocalizedString(\"tag\", \"alternative\") // tag is the key, alternative is, well, the alternative if the tag is not found in the .strings file\n\nExtra:\n- LocalizationReset // to reset to default values\n- LocalizationGetLanguage // to get the current language used",
