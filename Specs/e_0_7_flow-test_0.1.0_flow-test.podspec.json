  "description": "A pod to unit-test non-UI flow based on method selectors strings.\n\n\nWhen writing unit-tests for non-UI parts of an app, say like some kind of local in-memory store, for some scenarios, where there could be multiple ways of arriving at the same final result, basic unit-tests seem insufficient.\n\n`flow-test` makes it explicit that for a particular test, a certain list of methods need to be called, in a particular order, for it to be successful.",
