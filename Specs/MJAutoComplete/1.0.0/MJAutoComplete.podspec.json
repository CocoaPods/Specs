  "description": "                   \n                   The idea behind this component is to manage the relationship between the controller (with the model) and the auto complete view. \n\n                   + **Triggers**: which are simple invocations that happen when a delimiter is entered by the user. The trigger can either contain the data beforehand, and will do everything for you, or you can provide the data dynamically using the data source.\n\n                   + **Custom Cells**: You can easily assign custom cells for the component, and use a \"user info\" dictionary that will be passed to your cell to initialize it.\n\n                   + **Centralized**: You can easily centralize the manager and the data source, so you can simply instantiate the `MJAutoCompleteManager` anywhere to present the view, but then use that centralized data source to feed in the data.\n\n                   ... And much, much more, so please check out the fully documented github demo to learn more.\n                   \n",
