  "description": "JsonSwiftson is a JSON parser that exposes just a single API method `map()` for mapping JSON attributes to various Swift types including arrays.\n\n* Maps JSON text into Swift structures or classes.\n* Keeps the library tiny by using Swift generics and taking advantage of type casting features of the language.\n* Supports casting to optional types.\n* Indicates if the mapping was successful.\n* Makes sure mapping is fast.",
