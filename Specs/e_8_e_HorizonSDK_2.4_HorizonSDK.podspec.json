The provided sample apps contain their own API keys.\n\nThe library can be used on devices running iOS version 8 or higher. You can build your application using the latest Xcode.\n\nFor more information take a look at the Installation and Quick Start guides of the documentation.\n\n#leveling #filter #capture #video #photo",
