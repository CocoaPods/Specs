  "description": "                   In English, a word can either be singular or plural (e.g. 1 day, 2 days, 10 days).\n                   Some languages like Chinese have only one form (eg. 1 天, 2 天, 10 天), while others\n                   like Russian have three (1 день, 2 дня, 10 дней).\n                   \n                   JJPluralForm is adapted from Mozilla's PluralForm to handle plural forms in your\n                   Objective-C projects.\n",
