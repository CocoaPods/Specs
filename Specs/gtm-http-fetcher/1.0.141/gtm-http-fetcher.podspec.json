  "description": "                    GTM HTTP Fetcher makes it easy for Cocoa applications to perform http\n                    operations. The fetcher is implemented as a wrapper on NSURLConnection,\n                    so its behavior is asynchronous and uses operating-system settings on\n                    iOS and Mac OS X.\n\n                    This version can be used with iOS ≥ 5.0 or OS X ≥ 10.7.\n                    To target earlier versions of iOS or OS X, use\n\n                    pod 'gtm-http-fetcher', '~> 1.0.141'\n                  \n                    podspec version based on source SVN revision\n",
