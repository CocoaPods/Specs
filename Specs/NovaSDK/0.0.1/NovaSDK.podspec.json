  "description": "                   Allow the Nova off-camera flash hardware to be controlled\n                   from your app.\n\n                   [Nova](https://wantnova.com/) is a credit card sized hardware flash containing\n                   40 LEDs that can be color mixed from warm white to cool white. It is wireless\n                   and communication uses Bluetooth Low Energy.\n\n                   This SDK takes care of:\n                   * Automatically discovering the nearby flash without any user interaction\n                   (no manual pairing necessary).\n                   * Handling all the BluetoothLE communication and the custom Nova protocol\n                   built on top of this.\n\n                   Controlling the flash will only take a few lines of code.\n\n                   Integrate it into camera apps, or use the flash for other purposes such as\n                   a morse code beacon or artistic light display.\n",
