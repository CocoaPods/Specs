  "description": "Adjust Auto Layout constraints and watch your app update immediately without a rebuild + run cycle. This library allows you to specify your auto layout constraints in separate `.styles` files. In addition to writing constraints using Apple's Visual Format Language as well as an equation-based syntax, the library also supports setting of visual properties during development, such as colors, font (including dynamic type style names) and images.",
