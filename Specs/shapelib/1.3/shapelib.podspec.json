  "description": "If you don't know, you probably don't need this library. The Shapefile format is a working and interchange format promulagated by ESRI for simple vector data with attributes.\nAn excellent white paper on the shapefile format is available from ESRI, but it is .pdf format, so you will need Adobe Acrobat to browse it.\n\nThe file format actually consists of three files.\n\nXXX.shp - holds the actual vertices.\nXXX.shx - hold index data pointing to the structures in the .shp file.\nXXX.dbf - holds the attributes in xBase (dBase) format.  \n",
