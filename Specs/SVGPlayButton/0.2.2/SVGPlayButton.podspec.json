  "description": "This is a button to most likely use for playing audio or video. It toggles between 'play' and 'pause', has a circle around it, and has the capability to display a 'progress track' as whatever you've wired it up to play, plays. It's a sub-class of UIButton and all visual elements are SVG which means it will scale infinitely up and/or down. The example app demonstrates some of this capability via a slider.",
