  "description": "# TPLayout\nHarness the power of AutoLayout NSLayoutConstraints with a simplified, chainable and expressive syntax. The  API for iOS Auto Layout — impressively simple, immensely powerful.  PureLayout extends `UIView`, `NSArray`, and `NSLayoutConstraint` . TPLayout is an Objective-C library that also works (and looks!) great with Swift using a bridging header.\nWriting Auto Layout code from scratch isn't easy. TPLayout provides a fully capable and developer-friendly interface for Auto Layout. It is designed for clarity and simplicity, it adds only a thin layer of third party code and is engineered for maximum performance."
