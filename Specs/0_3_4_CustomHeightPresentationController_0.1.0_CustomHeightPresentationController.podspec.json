  "summary": "A presentation wrapper to show a controller that doesn't fill the full screen.",
  "description": "A tiny library (one UIViewController) that makes presenting modal screens much easier. It mimics the presentation animation and feel of UIActionSheet but leaves all design to the developer. A custom controller is animated up from the bottom of the screen and the view \"underneath\" is grayed out. Tapping anywhere on the presenting view will dismiss the presented controller.",
