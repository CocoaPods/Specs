  "description": "  \n  Having authenticated with a web service using OAuth2 and received the tokens I wanted to be able store them\n  sercurely. Whilst investigating secure storage on iOS I came across the ability to store small amounts of\n  data in the iOS Keychain. As the set of OAuth tokens is a couple of strings and number representing the\n  time to live of the token then this seemed like the ideal mechanism.\n  \n  However, the Keychain API isn't that simple nor succint to use and can only store a single piece of data. \n  This single piece of data can be an instance of NSData this means arbitrary objects can be stored.\n  I created a small library that allowd the Creation, Reading, Updating and Deletion (CRUD) of instances of\n  NSData. Futher rather than having to create instances of NSData I provided a layer on top that manipulates\n  any object that supports NSCoding.\n                   \n",
