  "description": "I am an iOS here named Muneeb Ur Rehman and am making this pod lib to help different users use it and with the help of it add two numbers and get thier results back :) also this pod elaborates over how to make simple pods for your use , if anyone wants to reach or discuss can contact me through the social media url for collaborations and stuff .\n\nHere is an example of how to get going with this pod library ignorer to add two numbers using this pod :\n\n\nExample :\n\nimport UIKit\nimport muneebfirstpodlib\n\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        \n        \n        let addTwoNumber = AddTwoNumbers()\n        \n        \n        print(\" (addTwoNumber.AddTwoNumbers(firstNumber: 4.3, secondNumber: 5.434))\" )\n        \n        addTwoNumber.showMeSomeConfoidentialInformationOnConsole()\n    \n        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.\n    }\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nExplanation : \n\nTo use the pod firstly you would need to install the pod , after that ignorer to Gert going , if you look into the example then you will see that firstly we will\n* import the muneebfirstpodlib \n* then we will make an instance of the class named AddTwoNumbers as shown in the example \n* with the help of the instance we will call the addTwoNumbers function and pass in the first and the second number , this function has a return type Double and will return the result after adding both the numbers then you can you use to do your stuff :D\n\nLikely in the example all of this is done in the viewdidload function , whereas you can utilise the explained steps and pod anywhere you where its appropriate .",
