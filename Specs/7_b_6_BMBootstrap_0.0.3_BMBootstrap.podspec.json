  "description": "In a few words this pod was created to save time when starting of a new project (and there comes the bootstrap part of the name). In many iOS apps, I've been using lots of similar approaches for simple issues such as UIColor/UIFont extensions and I believe it can not just be reused somehow by me in the next projects but also shared with the community.",
