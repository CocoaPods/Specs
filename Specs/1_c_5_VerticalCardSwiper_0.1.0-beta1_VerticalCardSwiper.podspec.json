  "summary": "A marriage between the Shazam Discover UI and Tinder, built with UICollectionView in Swift.",
  "description": "The goal of this project is to recreate the Discover UI in Shazam (which I think is a great, fun way to display content) in combination with a Tinder style of swiping cards to the left/right. The idea behind this is that in some cases, you don't want to swipe away cards, but keep them availible for later on. This implementation allows for that. And it's a fun way to interact with content.\nIt's built with a UICollectionView and a custom flowLayout.",
