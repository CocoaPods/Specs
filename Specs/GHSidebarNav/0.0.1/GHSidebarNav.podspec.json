The search goes full-screen and everything supports the standard orientations.\n\n    This project uses the Container View Controller methods introduced in iOS 5.0 so, it won't work on any version prior.\n    This project uses ARC so, you'll need Mac OS 10.7+ (Lion) and Xcode 4.2.1+ to build it.\n",
