In the process, i developed a couple of interesting solutions to common programming problems.\n\nThen I have extracted the things that I feel make life a lot easier into this package.\n\nCurrent version in development is 0.1.0.\n\nFeatures in 0.1.0:\n+ Promises thoroughly documented (see the specification at doc/Promise.md) and unit tested.\n+ Fetch undocumented but useful.\n+ JSQ in its embryonic state.\n+ Observable somewhat usable.",
