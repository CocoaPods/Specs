  "summary": "A forward-chaining inference engine rule engine",
  "description": "Rules provides a simple forward-chaining inference rule engine that is configurable at runtime.\n\nWhen you provide a set of _known facts_, and a set of _rules_, _inferred facts_ \ncan be determined.\n\nFor example:\n\n- _known fact_: the sky is blue\n- _rule_: if the sky is blue, then the weather is sunny\n- _inferrable fact_: the weather is sunny\n\nYou you make much more complicated rules than this, which are\nbased on more facts, even based on inferred facts.\n\nFor example:\n\n- _known fact_: the sky is blue\n- _known fact_: the season is summer\n- _rule_: if the sky is blue, then the weather is sunny\n- _rule_: if true, the beach is empty (this is a fallback rule)\n- _rule_: if the weather is sunny and the season is summer, then the beach is full\n- _inferred fact_: the beach is full\n\n- _known fact_: the season is autumn\n- _inferred fact_: the beach is empty\n\nRules can be specified using a simple textual format, and can be decoded from JSON\nto load into a `Brain`.",
