The KxMovie project includes only dated versions of the FFmpg libs which lack 64-bit simulator support and include various unsupported architectures for iOS11+.\n\nFor examples of use in an app, see the Nabto iOS RTSP demo at https://github.com/nabto/nabto-ios-rtsp.\n\nThe FFmpg source from which the binaries were built can be found here: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg\n\nWhen using these libs, notice that FFmpg is under LGPL: https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html.",
