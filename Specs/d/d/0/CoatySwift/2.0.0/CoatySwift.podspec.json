  "summary": "CoatySwift is a Swift implementation of the Coaty Collaborative IoT framework for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.",
  "description": "Using the Coaty [koÊŠti] framework as a middleware, you can build distributed applications out of decentrally organized application components, so called Coaty agents, which are loosely coupled and communicate with each other in (soft) real-time. The main focus is on IoT prosumer scenarios where smart agents act in an autonomous, collaborative, and ad-hoc fashion. CoatySwift agents can run on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.",
