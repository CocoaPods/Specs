  "description": "# PARTagPicker\n\nThis pod provides a view controller for choosing and creating tags in the style of wordpress or tumblr. This tag picker was originally used in the [Intrepid Pursuits](http://intrepid.io) app, Slate.\n\n## DEMO\n\nAs used in Slate:\n\n![DEMO IN SLATE](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Paul.Image.Bucket/PRTagPicker/tag_record1.gif)\n![DEMO IN SLATE](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Paul.Image.Bucket/PRTagPicker/tag_record4.gif)\n\nFrom example project:\n\n![DEMO IN EXAMPLE](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Paul.Image.Bucket/PRTagPicker/tag_record2.gif)\n![DEMO IN EXAMPLE](https://s3.amazonaws.com/Paul.Image.Bucket/PRTagPicker/tag_record3.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\nPARTagPicker is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install\nit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'PARTagPicker'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the PRTagPicker directory first.\n\nInclude `#import <PARTagPicker/PARTagPickerViewController.h>`.\n\nThe basic setup is to create an instance of `PARTagPickerViewController`, add it's view, and then add the controller as a child view controller.\n\nThe tags are passed in as `NSString` objects in an array. Anytime you change the `allTags` array, any existing `chosenTags` are updated to use references to the new strings if they contain a match in the updated array. Otherwise they continue to point to the old strings.\n\n## Options\n* You can customize colors using a PARTagColorReference object.\n* You can allow new tags with `allowsNewTags` boolean property on the controller.\n* You can set the `chosenTags` directly.\n* Delegate methods for when the chosenTags change and the tag picker changes size.\n* `- (void)tagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker visibilityChangedToState:(PARTagPickerVisibilityState)state `\n* `- (void)chosenTagsWereUpdatedInTagPicker:(PARTagPickerViewController *)tagPicker`\n\n## Notes\n\nThis is still a work in progress. If you have suggestions or run into issues, please create an issue on git or tweet me [@ThePaulRolfe](http://twitter.com/thepaulrolfe).\n\n## Updates\n* v1.0.3 - Making safe from some unexpected nil values.\n* v1.0.2 - Including `.xib`s in the pod now. Oops!\n* v1.0.0 - Added documentation and fixed bug with deselecting chosenTags. Added ability to use custom fonts in the tag cells.\n* v0.0.5 - Added expected functionality of chosenTags being removed when pressed.\n\n## Author\n\nPaul Rolfe, paul.a.rolfe@gmail.com, [@ThePaulRolfe](http://twitter.com/thepaulrolfe)\n\n## License\n\nPARTagPicker is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info."
