  "description": "**Sync** eases your everyday job of parsing a `JSON` response and getting it into Core Data. It uses a convention-over-configuration paradigm to facilitate your workflow.\n\n* Automatic mapping of CamelCase or snake_case JSON into Core Data\n* Handles operations in safe background threads\n* Thread-safe saving, we handle retrieving and storing objects in the right threads\n* Diffing of changes, updated, inserted and deleted objects (which are automatically purged for you)\n* Auto-mapping of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many)\n* Smart-updates, only updates your `NSManagedObject`s if the server values are different (useful when using `NSFetchedResultsController` delegates)\n* Uniquing, Core Data does this based on `objectID`s, we use your primary key (such as `id`) for this",
