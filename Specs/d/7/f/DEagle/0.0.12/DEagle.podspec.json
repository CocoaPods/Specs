  "description": "Data Eagle finds the ideal situation for messaging someone to bring them back to your app and automatically sends messages.\nSome of the factors considered are:\n\t\t1- After what series of events in the app? We find the most critical juncture in your app to retain or activate the highest number (or in case of retention most valuable) of users.\n\t\t2- What message? We A/B test different message content to find the best performing one and then automatically use that for future messages.\n\t\t3- To whom? We automatically define segments based on activity, spending, location and usage patterns and send messages relevant to each segment.\n\t\t4- What delay? It makes a difference how long after a user's last interaction you message them (one day, 4 days, 2 weeks...) and we find what works best for each individual through modeling users with similar behaviours.\n\t\t5- When during the day? Again sending a message at a time where users are more likely to view and open it; we find the best time through tests.",
