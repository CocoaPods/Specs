  "summary": "Strongly typed routing concept without static navigation flows.",
  "description": "Router is based on the idea of open navigation flows where any location inside an app can be reached from anywhere by passing instances of `Route` types to corresponding, preregistered `RouteHandler`s. While `Route`s provide necessary information about the desination, `RouteHandler`s will provide instances of a generic `View` type which can be specified as `AnyView`, `UIViewController`, `NSViewController` or any other type.",
