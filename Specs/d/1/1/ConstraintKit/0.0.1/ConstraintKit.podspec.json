  "description": "ConstraintKit makes it easy to activate, deactivate, and update layout constraints on iOS in Swift and Objective-C. It intelligently disables translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints on views participating in auto-layout, lets you update installed constraints without storing references to them, and lets you activate individual constraints in a single line of code, but it's most powerful feature is that it lets define the layout for an entire view in just one line.",
