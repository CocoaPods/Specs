It’s based on the math and technology in this blogpost: [khanlou.com/2012/01/cakeyframeanimation-make-it-bounce/](http://khanlou.com/2012/01/cakeyframeanimation-make-it-bounce/) which in turn was based partially on Matt Gallagher’s work here: [cocoawithlove.com/2008/09/parametric-acceleration-curves-in-core.html](http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/09/parametric-acceleration-curves-in-core.html).\n",
