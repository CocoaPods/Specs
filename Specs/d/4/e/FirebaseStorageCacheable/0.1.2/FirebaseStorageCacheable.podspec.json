  "summary": "FirebaseStorageCacheable is a libary to that downloads and caches the latest version of a file Firebase Storage.",
  "description": "This library allows you download and cache files hosted in Firebase Storage.\n\nIt uses the timestamps of your local file, compared to the timestamp of the remote file (by using the file meta information), to determine if the remote file is newer.\n\nThe `update`, replaces the local file with a copy of the remote one. The API includes onComplete and onError closures as parameters to keep your code loosely coupled.\n\nWhen updatig a file, you may also provide an onProgress closure to can inform your users of the download progress. Or you can let them know they have up-to-date data.\n\nIt also supports copying a bundled file to the target location, as well, so your users don't have to download your app, then download the data next, before using your app.",
