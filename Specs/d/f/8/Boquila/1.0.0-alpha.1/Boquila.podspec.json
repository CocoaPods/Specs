  "description": "I love using remote configuration software in my mobile apps. They allow me to make changes to live apps instantly without having to submit my app to the app store. \n\nWhile working with remote configuration in my apps, I have thought about some cool ideas for using remote config in my apps. Using JSON strings for remote config values and string replacements for dynamic values just to name a few. \n\nBoquila is a project for lovers of remote configuration software. Boquila aims to...\n* **Be small.** Don't try to do everything including the kitchen sink. Try to be as minimal of a project as possible and allow the developer to opt-in to features they want. \n* **Consistent experience.** No matter what remote config service that you use, the API remains the same. \n* **Flexible.** Boquila is not opinionated. It does only what it needs to do and nothing more.",
