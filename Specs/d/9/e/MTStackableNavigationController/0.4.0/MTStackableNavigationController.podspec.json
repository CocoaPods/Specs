  "description": "                    MTStackableNavigationController aims to be an API-compatible replacement for\n                    UINavigationController, with special sauce for Facebook / Path style stacked\n                    navigation. In contrast to most of the other view controller projects based on\n                    this paradigm, MTStackableNavigationController is targeted exclusively for use\n                    as a direct replacement for UINavigationController; layered navigation and deck\n                    style interaction are already done well by other controllers.\n",
