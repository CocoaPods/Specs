  "summary": "A well-organizaed workspace for the development of multi-plaform Pods",
  "description": "This Pod provides a simple Xcode project and workspace that is organized for the creation of multi-plafrom Pods.  It supports OSX and IOS, and can be easily extended to support additional Swift platforms.  After installation, the workspace may be used to develop a multi-plaform Pod.  The names of the products, and other references, should be changed from 'MultiPlatformPod' to the name of your actual Pod.  Its organization and configuation provide a solution that builds and runs on IOS and OSX, overcoming a number of issues of getting this all to work on multiple platforms.  Thus, the developer of a Pod intended to work on multiple platforms can save a lot of time in having to deal with those issues.",
