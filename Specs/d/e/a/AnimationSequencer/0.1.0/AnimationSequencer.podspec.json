  "description": "Very simple and scalable UIView animation extension without nested completion closures. It uses standard iOS api but wraps around a nicer look.\n\nUsally we make animations using system `animate()` method and completion block, but in my experience it's not scalable, very hard to read and it's hard to remove or add a new animation according to design specifications.",
