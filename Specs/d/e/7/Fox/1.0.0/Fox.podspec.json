  "description": "    Why write tests when you can generate them? Fox is a port of Clojure's\n    popular test.check.\n\n    Specify your tests in terms of properties your code should hold. Fox's job is\n    to generate tests to find a counter-example that your property does not hold.\n\n    Fox will also shrink the counter-example to the smallest possible example\n    to make it easier to debug failures.\n",
