  "description": "The wrapper supports local subtitles .srt and .vtt. AVPlayer doesn't provide interface for such feature (only built-in subtitles). Also AVPlayerViewController is expected for using in fullscreen mode. But you can use this wrapper for playing a video in windowed mode (with/without subtitles).",
