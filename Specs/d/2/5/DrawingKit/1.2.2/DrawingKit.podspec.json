  "description": "DrawingKit provides simple Swift API to add freehand drawing to any iOS project. It chains together touches to form smooth composite BÃ©zier curves and quickly draws them to the screen. All curves are saved to an image shortly after drawing, and that image is available for the host application to use. Line colour, background colour, and line thickness are all easily customisable. DrawingKit is perfect for easily capturing a signature or other user input.",
