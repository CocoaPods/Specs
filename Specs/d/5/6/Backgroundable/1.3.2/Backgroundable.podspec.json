  "description": "Backgroundable is a collection of handy classes, extensions and global functions to handle being in the background using Swift.\n\nIt's main focus is to add functionalities to existing `Operation`s and `OperationQueue`s, without adding overheads to the runtime (aka it's fast) nor to the developer (aka there's very little to learn).\n\nIt's powerful because it's simple.",
