This can be useful for example in discarding duplicate remote notifications by examining the dictionaries sent from the server.\n\nThis libary supports overriding the default storage type (PList) with custom storage such as SQLLite or NSUserDefaults. Simply conform to KMDDDStorageType and set StorageType to be custom on the manager.",
