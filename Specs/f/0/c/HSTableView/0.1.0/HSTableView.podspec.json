  "description": "A simpler, more elegant UITableView. Rows are managed by objects. Things happen with blocks.\n\nYour whole table is declared up front with no need for delegates\n\nThe table view uses a responder chain approach to provide settings. Any setting can be set at the row level, the section level or the table level.\n\nThis allows simple configuration at the table level, and easy customisation at the row level.\n\nBlocks are used for tap handlers, delete handlers, etc.\n\nDefault (coloured) accessories are supported\n\nHSTableView is suitable for situations where there is a known finite number of rows (although the number can change). It doesn’t support infinite scrolling tables (you’ll have to use UITableView and delegates for that!)",
