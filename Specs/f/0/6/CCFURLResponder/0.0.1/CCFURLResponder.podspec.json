  "description": "                   An important feature of iOS applications is the ability to respond to incoming URLs.  Your application\n                   can register a URL scheme that it knows how to handle.  But then what?  CCFURLResponder allows you to declare \n                   patterns of URLs that are based on the application's declared scheme and turn the received URLs into \n                   NSNotification objects.\n",
