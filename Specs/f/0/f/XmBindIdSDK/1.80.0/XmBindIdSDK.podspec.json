  "description": "The BindID service is an app-less, strong portable authenticator offered by Transmit Security. BindID uses FIDO-based biometrics for secure, convenient, and consistent passwordless authentication. This guide explains how to integrate BindID into your web applicationâ€”including the changes required for your login page and backend application. Since BindID implements the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard, the integration steps are similar to other OIDC-based services like Sign in with Google.",
