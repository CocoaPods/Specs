  "description": "An easy to use function for producing a curried version of almost another function. Just wrap your function in a call like so ‘curry(myFunction)’ and the result will be a curried version of your function. A useful tool for working with parser combinators and other functional programming work. Has overrides for different numbers of parameters, currently up to 12. Pull requests for improvements are welcome.",
