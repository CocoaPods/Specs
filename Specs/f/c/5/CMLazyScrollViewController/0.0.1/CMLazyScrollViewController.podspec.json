  "description": "CMLazyScrollViewController is a controller that I developped in first place to have an infinite carousel of images easily and that i don't have to redo it everytime. And I thought that it would be better than a basic carousel to have UIViewControllers instead of UIViews, to have more complex page. Also I choose to inherit from a UIViewController instead of a UIView because I wanted to be able to add childViewControllers",
