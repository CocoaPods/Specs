It opens ViewControllers and other coordinators. All screens are developed to be totally independent from each other. A ViewController is never opened from another one - only coordinator should do this. \n\nYou create a hierarchy of coordinators starting with the AppCoordinator. He \"knows\" which flow should be first depending on situation.",
