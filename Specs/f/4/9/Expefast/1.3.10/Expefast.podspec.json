  "description": "This is the official IOS SDK for Expefast. This SDK connects your IOS Store to the Expefast API.\n                       This API SDK functions as a client-side POST, taking input of form data and sending a properly-formatted JSON object\n                       to the Expefast API server. The result is a redirect of the client browser to the appropriate bank/payment method URL.\n                       Upon a successful, failed, or cancelled transaction, the client will be redirected to the URL specified in the API.",
