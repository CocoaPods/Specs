  "description": "The color of a UISegmentedControl in the UIKit is customizable only in the bar style mode, so if one uses the plain or bordered mode, the only possible color is blue. This could be a problem if blue does not fit well in your app or in a view. This class allows you to chose any tint color.\n",
