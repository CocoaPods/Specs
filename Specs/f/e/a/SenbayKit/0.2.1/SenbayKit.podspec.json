  "description": "The spread of smartphones allows us to freely capture video and diverse hardware sensors' data (e.g., accel erometer, gyroscope). While recording such data is relatively simple, it is often challenging to share and restream this data to other people and applications. Such capability is very valuable for a range of applications such as a context-aware prototyping/developing platform, an integrated data recording and analysis tool, and a sensor-data based video editing system. To enable such complex operations, we propose Senbay, a platform for instant sensing, integrating, and restreaming multiple-sensor data streams. The platform embeds collected sensor data into a video frame using an animated two-dimensional barcode via real-time video processing. The video-embedded sensor data, dubbed Senbay Video, can be easily restreamed to other people and reused by data rich, context-aware applications.",
