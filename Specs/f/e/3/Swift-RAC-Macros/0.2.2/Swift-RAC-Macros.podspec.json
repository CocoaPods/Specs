  "description": "                   Swift struct called \"RAC\" replaces the RAC macro from \n                   ReactiveCocoa 2.x. A Swift function named RACObserve replaces\n                   that macro. Combined with the custom `<~` operator, you can \n                   bind to `dynamic` properties.\n",
