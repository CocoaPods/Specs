  "description": "Base-ios repository consists of useful extensions, general classes and protocols \nthat we gather and use while working on our projects. The main goal is to create \na central point of such snippets that can be reused within other projects. \nWe constantly review and enrich the repository aiming to reach maximum reusability. \nWe take full advantage of reactive programming features and incorporate it within \nour projects. For that purpose we use external libraries RxSwift, Action and \nRxDataSources as dependencies for the base-ios library.",
