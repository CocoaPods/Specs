  "description": "                   JAMSVGImage is used to parse and display SVG image graphics in iOS. The great thing about SVG images is that they are scalable and look great no matter how big, small, rotated, or otherwise transformed you make them. Use them in place of UIImage and UIImageViews and never have to worry about resizing or @2x versions ever again!\n",
