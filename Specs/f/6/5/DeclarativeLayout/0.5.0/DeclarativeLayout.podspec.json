  "description": "* Declarative - Tell the framework what the layout of your views should be and let the framework intelligently add/modify/remove constraints and views for you.\n* Expressive - Let your code visually express the hierarchy of your views.\n* Fast - The example below, running on an iPhone X will update the layout in under 3 milliseconds.\n* Flexible - Write the same constraints you already do, using whatever autolayout constraint DSL you prefer.\n* Small - Small and readable Swift 4 codebase.",
