  "description": "Savior is a client-side ORM written in Swift for make storing data delightful. Built to be data-agnostic, Savior lets you easily add persistence capabilities to your iOS app. The best part is it doesn't require you to change or subclass your existing data models. Just conform your models to the 'Storable' protocol to get started. Currently Realm is the default provider, but Pull Requests are welcome to add more!",
