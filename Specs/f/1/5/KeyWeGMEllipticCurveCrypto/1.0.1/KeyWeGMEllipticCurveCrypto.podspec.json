  "description": "An Objective-C library for Elliptic Curve Digital Signing Algorithm (ECDSA) and for Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).\n\nECDSA allows signatures to be generated using a private key and validated using a public key.\n\nECDH allows two identities to use their own private keys and each other's public key to generate a shared secret, which can then be used for encryption.\n\nThis library is largely based on the easy-ecc library (https://github.com/kmackay/easy-ecc).",
