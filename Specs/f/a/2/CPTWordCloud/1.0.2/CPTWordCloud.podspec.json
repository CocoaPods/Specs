  "description": "Framework used to create a word cloud graphic from an input of string content. Includes options for several word rotation variations. The color and size of the words will vary based on the count of the word in the input text string and offer multiple algorithms for determining font sizing per word. You can define a single font for the cloud or go crazy and define an array of fonts to use randomly across the cloud. The example project gives a good demonstration of most of the major features and options. This project builds on some of the work originally done by Gal Niv https://github.com/galniv/WordCloud",
