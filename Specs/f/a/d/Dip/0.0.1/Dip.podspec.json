  "description": "Dip is a Swift framework to manage your Dependencies between your classes\nin your app.\n\nIt's aimed to be very simple to use while improving testability\nof your app by allowing you to get rid of those sharedInstances and instead\ninject values based on protocol resolution.\n\nDefine your API using a protocol, then ask Dip to resolve this protocol into\nan instance dynamically in your classes. Then your App and your Tests can be\nconfigured to resolve the protocol using a different instance or class so this\nimprove testability by decoupling the API and the concrete class used to implement it.\n\nIt's not real Dependency Injection _per se_, but it's close.",
