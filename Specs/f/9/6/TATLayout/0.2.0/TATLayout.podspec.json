It provides a higher level API to layout constraints that makes your layouts easier to read, mantain and modify dynamically.\n                            \n                            Features:\n                            * Category in NSLayoutConstraint providing a factory method for creating constraints using a linear equation format string.\n                            * Category in UIView providing methods for constraining layout attributes.\n",
