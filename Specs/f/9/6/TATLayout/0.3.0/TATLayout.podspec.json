It provides a high level API to layout constraints that makes your layouts easier to read, mantain and modify dynamically.\n                            \n                            Features:\n                            * Category in `NSLayoutConstraint` providing a factory method for creating constraints using a linear equation format string.\n                            * Category in `NSLayoutConstraint ` providing methods for auto installation and uninstallation.\n                            * A couple of helper methods useful for working with layouts.\n",
