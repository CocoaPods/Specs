This Agreement is governed by the terms in the commercial agreement separately entered into by Licensee and Licensor (the\n    “Commercial Agreement”), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Defined terms in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein, have\n    the meanings given to them in the Commercial Agreement.\n    \n    1. License: Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants Licensee a revocable, royalty-free, nonexclusive,\n        nontransferable, nonassignable license (subject to Licensee’s continued compliance with this Agreement) to install and use a reasonable number of\n        copies of the Software to be used solely in the manner described in the documentation contained in the Software and as further authorized in the\n        Commercial Agreement. Licensee may not copy the Software or any portion thereof except as expressly permitted herein. For the purposes of this\n        provision \"copy\" shall not include copying of statements and instructions of the Software or any portion thereof that naturally occurs during normal\n        program execution when used in accordance with and for the purposes described in the documentation or in the course of making unmodified copies of\n        the Software or documentation as part of the regular back-up of the Software in accordance with standard industry business practices.\n    2. EULA: If applicable, Licensee shall incorporate the End User License Agreement referenced in the Commercial Agreement.\n    3.

Rights in Software: This Agreement is not a sale and does not transfer to Licensee any title or ownership interest in or to the Software or any\n        patent, copyright, trade secret, trade name, trademark or other proprietary or intellectual property rights related to the Software. Except for the\n        rights expressly granted herein, Licensor retains all of its right, title and interest in and to the Software. Licensee shall not remove, alter, or\n        obscure any proprietary notices contained on or within the Software and shall reproduce such notices on any back-up copy of the Software.\n    5. Open Source Software: “Open Source Software” means any software or other material included in the Software which is (1) subject to a license (a)\n        listed at [http://opensource.org/licenses/](http://opensource.org/licenses/) as of the effective date, (b) that meet the criteria listed at\n        [http://opensource.org/docs/definition.php](http://opensource.org/docs/definition.php) as of the effective date, or (c) that is licensed under a free\n        software, open source software, or similar licensing model; and (2) which if distributed by Licensee would (a) impose any obligations on Licensee to\n        provide reports or royalties, or to disclose any information to a third party, or (b) impose any requirements that any patents related to the\n        Software must be licensed to, or may be asserted against, recipients of the Software.

Open Source Software also includes libraries from the FFmpeg project under the\n        LGPLv2.1. The Open Source Software is not subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Instead, each item of Open Source Software is\n        licensed under the terms of the end user license that accompanies such Open Source Software. Nothing in this Agreement limits Licensee’s rights\n        under, or grants Licensee rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end user license for the Open Source Software.\n    6.

LICENSEE IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AND ASSUMES ALL RISKS\n        ASSOCIATED WITH ITS USE, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FFMPEG OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n    9. Indemnification: Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor, its affiliates, their respective successors and their respective\n        officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives for any claim, liability, loss or damage arising out of: (a) Licensee’s breach of any\n        term of this Agreement; and (b) any claim of allegedly unauthorized use or violation of any third-party patent, copyright, trade secret, or other\n        intellectual property.\n    10.

Neither Party will have authority to or will hold itself out as having any authority to incur, assume, or create, orally or in writing, any\n        liability, obligation or undertaking of any kind in the name of, or on behalf of, or in any way binding upon, the other.\n"
