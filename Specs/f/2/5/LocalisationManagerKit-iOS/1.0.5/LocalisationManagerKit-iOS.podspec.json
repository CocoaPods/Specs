  "description": "Read the localisations from a JSON file. One JSON file has the localisations for all language codes. Allow the parent app to set the required language by NSUserDefaults key. If the user provided a missing/wrong JSON file the KIT should handle from the default one not to return keys or nulls. If the parent app didn’t define a specific language, the kit should detect the phone locale and display the language accordingly.",
