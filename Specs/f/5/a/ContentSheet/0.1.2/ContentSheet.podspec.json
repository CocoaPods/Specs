  "description": "ContentSheet enables presenting any content in an ActionSheet.\nThe content provider has to follow 'ContentSheetContentProtocol'.\nExtensions for UIViewController and UINavigationController have been added in the pod itself so that comes right out of the box.\nIt is also possible to have the content expand or collapse based on collapsed height and expanded height.\nIf there is a scrollview and you'd like to expand or collapse the content seemlessly on scroll, that is also possible.\nYou could customize the background and whether the sheet should be dismissed on tapping outside content or not.\nCallbacks are given for all the events as well. Both 'ContentSheetContentProtocol' and 'ContentSheetDelegate' get\ncallbacks for different events.\n\nCheckout the example in the code.",
