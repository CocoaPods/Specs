  "description": "\n      OCHamcrest is:\n      * a library of \"matcher\" objects that let you declare rules for whether a\n        given object matches the criteria or not;\n      * a framework for writing your own matchers.\n      Matchers are useful for a variety of purposes, such as UI validation. But\n      they're most commonly used for writing unit tests that are expressive and\n      flexible.\n\n      OCHamcrest is used for both iOS or OS X development, and is compatible with:\n      * OCUnit (SenTestingKit)\n      * Kiwi\n      * Cedar\n      * GHUnit\n      * Google Toolbox for Mac (GTM)\n      * OCMock\n      * OCMockito\n  ",
