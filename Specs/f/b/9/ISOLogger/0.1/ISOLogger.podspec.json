But sometimes they drown out your own voice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The most useful entries are the ones you add yourself, right before you run the code.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ISOLogger is a simple tool that sends all existing log output to a file. It's still there if you need it. But your Xcode console is reserved so you can hear yourself think.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor a more detailed explanation, read the [blog post][1].\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[1]: http://funroll.co/ \"Introducing ISOLogger\"\n",
