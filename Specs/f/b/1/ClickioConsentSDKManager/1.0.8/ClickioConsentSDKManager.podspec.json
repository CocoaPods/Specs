  "summary": "Native SDK for managing user consents, integrating a WebView-based consent dialog into iOS apps for streamlined privacy compliance.",
  "description": "ClickioConsentSDK is a robust privacy-focused toolkit designed to simplify GDPR, CCPA, and global compliance for iOS apps. It features a fully customizable WebView-based consent dialog that seamlessly integrates with your app's UI while dynamically adapting to regional regulations. Key capabilities include:\n\n* ATT-CMP Flow Orchestration: Optional App Tracking Transparency (ATT) pre-permission prompts with logic to conditionally display consent dialogs based on user choices.\n* Real-Time Compliance: Automatic updates for consent texts/purposes via centralized configurations without app store resubmissions.\n* Granular Control: Capture user preferences for ads, analytics, and data sharing with purpose/VendorID-level consent tracking.\n* Cross-Platform Sync: Export standardized TC/AC Strings and Google Consent Mode signals for backend/services alignment.\n* Developer-Centric: Objective-C, SwiftUI, UIKit support and extensible web-to-native communication layer.\n\nIdeal for apps requiring scalable privacy management with minimal code footprint, ensuring audit-ready compliance across jurisdictions.'",
