  "description": "                   LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression\n                   speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It also features\n                   an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically\n                   reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems. \n",
