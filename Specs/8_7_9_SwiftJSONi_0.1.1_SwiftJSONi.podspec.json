  "description": "A light weight Swift JSON Model, completely written in Swift, that makes handling JSON data in Swift and Objective-C very easy and safe. No more type casting of data and safe unwraping. No more crashing because of force unwraping, Index Out of bound, missing key etc.. Its totally nil safe as all the optional handling is done. The model is basically of struct type making it even thread safe and very light. It supports chaining. This lib makes your code a lot neater, simpler and more readable. SwiftJSONi follows the rules of JSON described under RC-7129 and www.json.org. It allows parsing fragments.",
