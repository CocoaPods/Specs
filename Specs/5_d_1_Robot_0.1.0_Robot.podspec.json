Easily emulate high-level user interaction through UIKit.\n\n\t\t\tUnlike KIF, this does not aim to perfectly emulate how users interact with the system. \n\t\t\tInstead, trying to replicate the same behavior while minimizing the overhead of \n\t\t\ttime-based operations. A perfect example is disabling animations to speed up running of tests.\n\n\t\t\tAlso unlike KIF, Robot does not aim to be a full integration testing solution. Rather, it \n\t\t\trelies on other testing frameworks to do assertion and running. Besides XCTest, there are \n\t\t\tsome popular BDD frameworks:\n\n\t\t\t\t*Cedar\n\t\t\t\t*Specta / Expecta\n\t\t\t\t*Kiwi\n",
