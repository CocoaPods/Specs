  "description": "                   GameTimer incorporates 2 timers that work in unison - referred to as longTimer and shortTimer. The shortTimer acts as a 'finer' resolution timer that can be used to update a progressbar or continually poll a network connection (for example). It's interval is usually set to a fraction of the longTimer.\n\n                   GameTimer automatically pauses when the app enters the BACKGROUND and 'unpauses' when the app is ACTIVE again.\n",
