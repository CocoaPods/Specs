If you\n                       only set a title, it looks just like the default. However, it supports\n                       an optional subtitle to be displayed unterneath the title.\n\n                       * Changes to title or subtitle can be animated (optional)\n                       * Supports Interface Builder customization\n                       * Looks good in Landscape & Portrait\n                       * Universal for iPhone and iPad\n",
