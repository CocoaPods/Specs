  "description": "MeshPipe is an IPC (inter-process communication) library for iOS using UDP networking.\nIt allows multiple running applications on a single iOS device to send arbitrary data to each other.\nIt:\n\n* Automatically connects to all other MeshPipe apps that are configured with the same port\n* Detects when other apps disconnect or disappear, giving you a list of available peers\n\nSince it is based on UDP, there are some hard-wired limitations:\n\n* Message must fit within a single UDP datagram. The current UDP datagram max size on iOS is 9216 bytes.\n* Delivery is not guaranteed. Messages may or may not get through, may arrive from seemingly unavailable peers, or arrive out of order.\n* You may receive malicious or unexpected data, as any app on the phone could craft a message and send it to your app.\n* Communication is insecure, and any app on the device might listen in or even change messages.",
