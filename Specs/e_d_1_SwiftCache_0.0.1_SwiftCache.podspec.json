  "description": "                  A beautifully lightweight cache written for Swift. It has been tested on iOS and OS X. I wrote it over an hour because I couldn't find something good enough and I think you'll like it.\n\n                  Tested with XCode 6.3.1 with Swift 1.2. It requires SwiftyJSON but that also means it's the only cache I know that works with SwiftyJSON and Alamofire and reliably so!\n\n                  Give it a spin.\n",
