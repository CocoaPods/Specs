  "description": "Networking in Swift can be tedious from the get go. Type safety & reusability are often overlooked for the sake of getting up to speed. This is where Netswift comes in!\n\nNetswift allows you to easily write network calls in a very structured and maintainable way. It does so by using protocols with associated types & generic classes very extensively.",
