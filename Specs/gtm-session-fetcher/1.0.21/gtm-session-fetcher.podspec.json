  "description": "GTMSessionFetcher makes it easy for Cocoa applications to perform http operations. The fetcher is implemented as a wrapper on NSURLSession, so its behavior is asynchronous and uses operating-system settings on iOS and Mac OS X.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nSimple to build; only one source/header file pair is required\nSimple to use: takes just two lines of code to fetch a request\nSupports upload and download sessions\nFlexible cookie storage\nAutomatic retry on errors, with exponential backoff\nSupport for generating multipart MIME upload streams\nEasy, convenient logging of http requests and responses\nSupports plug-in authentication such as with gtm-oauth2\nEasily testable; self-mocking\nAutomatic rate limiting when created by the GTMSessionFetcherService factory class\nFully independent of other projects\n",
