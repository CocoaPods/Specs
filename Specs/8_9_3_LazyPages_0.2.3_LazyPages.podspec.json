  "description": "- Lazy load of view controllers, that allow us not to have all of them in memory when initialazing LazyPages.\n                  - Furthermore, we can also initialise it with all the UIViewController instances or with closures that provides them.\n                  - View controllers are cached, and freed when memory is low.\n - View controllers can be instances of different subclasses of UIViewController.\n - Highly customizable, we can place the index and pages views as we wish, as well as desigining the index cells, with the help of Storyboard. Scroll directions could be set as wished.\n- Public API to go to a desired page.\n - Usage of UIViewController, not UIView.",
