  "description": "GetRated is a handy class to help you promote your iPhone & iPad apps. GetRated uses SKStoreReviewController (available in iOS 10.3 and later) to prompt users to rate your app after using it for a few days. GetRated will then manage further attempts to get a rating by retrying periodically, in line with App Store recomendations. This approach is one of the best ways to get positive ratings by targetting only regular users (who presumably like the app or they wouldn't keep using it!).\n\nGetRated will ensure that a number of configurable requirements are met before prompting. These include daysUntilFirstPrompt, daysUntilFuturePrompts, minimumDaysUntilPromptAfterVersionUpdate, usesUntilPrompt and eventsUntilPrompt.\n\nBy default GetRated will evenly spread 3 requests to prompt per year in order to make the best use of the maximum 3 prompts per year limit set by Apple.\n\nGetRated was inspired by, and in parts based on [iRate](https://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate) by Nick Lockwood.",
