  "description": "  Pajdeg is a self-contained C library for mutating (modifying) PDFs. \n  \n  It's built around the principles of a pipe, where the original PDF is examined, needed changes are determined and tasks are \"attached\" based on page number, object ID, etc. and then simply sent through a pipe into a new PDF with the desired modifications. \n",
