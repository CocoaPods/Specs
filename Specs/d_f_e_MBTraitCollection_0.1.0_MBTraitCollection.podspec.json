  "summary": "UIViewController category provides iOS7 compatible access to UITraitCollection object by exposing new property mbTraitCollection.",
  "description": "\t\t\t\t\tTrait collections are new as of iOS 8 and even if they compile with the latest SDK even for deployment targets older than 8.0, their use will cause crash in iOS 7 application. This renders them unusefull until application deployment target is restricted to 8.0.\n\n                    To solve that problem, I've created a category on UIViewController which exposes a new property mbTraitCollection. When accessing this property a backwards-compatible MBTraitCollection class will be lazy-loaded for you. Class is basically a wrapper around UITraitCollection and will use native behavior when possible (i.e. in iOS >= 8). On older iOS version, this class will use other available techniques to determine device characteristics for you, thus allowing you to use trait collection even on iOS 7.\n",
