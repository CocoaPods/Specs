  "description": "This is a UI element for iOS that shows a 'no content' message over an existing view. It can be used to show a missing content message and suggest an action.\n\nFor example, consider we have an ecommerce app with a shopping cart screen that shows a list of products. If the user goes to the empty cart screen we can show a \"Cart is empty\" message and a \"Search\" button.",
