This text:\n \n       This sentence has a lot of words on\n       the top line.\n \n   Becomes:\n \n       This sentence has a lot\n       of words on the top line.\n \n2. This text:\n \n       This sentence has a single\n       orphan.\n \n   Becomes:\n \n       This sentence has\n       a single orphan.\n\nFeatures:\n- Works with all devices running iOS 9+.\n- Uses `drawText(in:)` internally (as opposed to creating subviews), so any `UILabel` reference can be replaced with `EvenlyWrappedLabel` and Everything Will Just Workâ„¢.\n- Works with any number of lines and any text alignment.\n- Works with autolayout and honors intrinsic sizing.\n- Works with labels created in code and in Interface Builder.\n- Example app with lots of real-time configurations that lets you see the text wrap as you type.",
