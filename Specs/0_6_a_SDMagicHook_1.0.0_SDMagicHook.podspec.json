  "description": "Classical method swizzling with method_exchangeImplementations is quite simple, but it has a lot of limitations and defects:\n\nYou have to add a new method in a class category everytime when you want to swizzle a method.\nDifferent method implementation with same selector in different category will case method conflicts.\nThe method swizzling will affect all the instances of the target classï¼Œhowever in most cases it is not necessary but even has side effects.\n\nNow SDMagicHook will solve the problems mentioned above.",
