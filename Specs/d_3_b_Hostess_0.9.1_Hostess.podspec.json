  "description": "A Swift implementation of NSHost (Host in Swift) that works on iOS, OS X and tvOS. Hostess.swift is safe to use in a framework because it does not require a bridging header.\n\nHostess.swift was created because NSHost is unavailable on iOS and CFHost does not offer the full functionality of it OS X counterpart. In addition, those developers hoping for a pure-Swift solution were out of luck without using a bridging header. Hostess.swift does not use a bridging header, so is safe to use in Framework development. It is 100% Swift and tries to maintain as much type safety as the low level networking C API will allow.",
