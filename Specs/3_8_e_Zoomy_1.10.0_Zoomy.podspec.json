  "description": "Zoomy allows UIScrollView like zooming on UIImageViews in any view hierarchy with close to no alterations to clients layout. Zoomy works by initialy performing translate and scale manipulations on a view mimicking the original view that is to bee zoomed from, triggered by a pinch and (while the pinch has started) a pan gesture. As soon as the initial gesture is done a scrollView is placed and configured in the optimal postion in relation to the last location of the manipulated view. From this point on all manipulations are happening inside a scrollview and behave like you'd expect it to do.",
