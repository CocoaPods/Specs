Built on top of AFNetworkingâ€™s blocks-based architecture, it fetches responses asynchronously without any waiting on the main thread. It supports:\n\n\n  * Caching results with customizable expiry times,\n  * Requesting forecasts by natural-language location strings, `CLLocation` coordinates, and Yahoo WOEIDs,\n  * Customizing default temperature, pressure, speed, and distance return units.\n",
