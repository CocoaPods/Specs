  "description": "You have a good separation of UI and data-network but you make multiple network requests at data layer and you are having troubles with notifying UI layer about that? You dont want to have extra notifying parameter in your data layer classes and you dont wanna deal with blocks-delegate methods? You dont wanna use ReactiveCocoa since it is huge and a totally different paradigm? Then you are at the right place! MBTaskContainer is for you! Return it to UI layer from data layer and then you can modify if from any thread and layer! UI layer can query active tasks with safety whenever it is needed.",
