  "summary": "Cloe is Redux for SwiftUI, built on Combine, striving for excellent feng shui.",
  "description": "Heavily inspired by ReSwift, but Cloe does away with the bespoke pub/sub system\nand instead uses Combine. The composeMiddleware code is easier to read than ReSwift\nand the Middleware type is simpler making it easier to write your own Middleware.\nComes with both the classic Thunk middleware, as well as a middleware specifically\nfor Combine pipelines.",
