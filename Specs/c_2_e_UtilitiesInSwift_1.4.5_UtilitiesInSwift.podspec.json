  "description": "Utility functions for swift that have been created through the years.  Some converted from other languages.  \nThe utilities are broken down by type categories (I did what I thought was ok).\n  \n  * Queues            --> I mainly created these so as Swift morphs, I can easily adjust the function bodies and not all over the code base, plus, I may want to add later functionality.\n  * NumberToWords     --> Convert decimal values to words for use in writing a check.  Cause we all write checks these days....\n  * FileSystem        --> clear out temp files, determine available space on device             \n  * CancelableClosure --> I use it for waiting for 0.5 seconds to elapse on key strokes, then call some lookup function \n  * UIColor Extension --> great way to save a color value as an Int then pull from database and easily convert back to UIColor\n  * Int Extension     --> convert Int to String distance display in feet/miles, 123456 to 123,456,  123456 to 123.5k (thousands), 123456789 to 123.46m (million)\n  * AutoFillTextField --> if trigger char is matched while typing in textfield a popup selection list is displayed",
