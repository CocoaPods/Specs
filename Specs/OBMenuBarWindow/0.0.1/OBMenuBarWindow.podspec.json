  "description": "                    The OBMenuBarWindow class is an NSWindow subclass that adds\n                    the ability to attach the window to an icon in the menu bar\n                    in OS X. It emulates much of the look and feel of NSPopover\n                    but retains the appearance and functionality of a regular\n                    window, including the title bar and traffic light controls.\n                    The user can drag the window to and from the menu bar icon\n                    to attach and detach it from the menu bar.\n",
