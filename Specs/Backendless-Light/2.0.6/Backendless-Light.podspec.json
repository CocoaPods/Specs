  "description": "Backendless is a development and a run-time platform. It helps software developers to create \nmobile and desktop applications while removing the need for server-side coding. The platform \nconsists of six core backend services which developers typically spend time implementing for \neach new applications. These services include:\n\n\tUser Service – facilitates user registrations, login, logout, session management.\n\tData Service – is responsible for data management – storage, retrieval, updates and deletion.\n\tMessaging Service – handles message publishing, broadcast, filtered message delivery and native mobile push notifications.\n\tFiles Service – is responsible for file uploads, downloads and file sharing.\n\tGeo-Location Service – supports geo spatial data imports and geo queries.\n\n\tThe Backendless services can be accessed through an easy-to-use APIs which we packaged into our \n\tSDKs. The behavior of the services and the business logic behind them can be customized through \n\tthe Development Console.",
