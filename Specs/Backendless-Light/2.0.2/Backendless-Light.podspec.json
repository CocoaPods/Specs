  "description": "\tBackendless is a development and a run-time platform. It helps software developers to create \n\tmobile and desktop applications while removing the need for server-side coding. The platform \n\tconsists of six core backend services which developers typically spend time implementing for \n\teach new applications. These services include:\n\n\t\tUser Service – facilitates user registrations, login, logout, session management.\n\t\tData Service – is responsible for data management – storage, retrieval, updates and deletion.\n\t\tMessaging Service – handles message publishing, broadcast, filtered message delivery and native mobile push notifications.\n\t\tFiles Service – is responsible for file uploads, downloads and file sharing.\n\t\tMedia Service – provides support for video and audio streaming (up and down) and server-side recording.\n\t\tGeo-Location Service – supports geo spatial data imports and geo queries.\n\n\t\tThe Backendless services can be accessed through an easy-to-use APIs which we packaged into our \n\t\tSDKs. The behavior of the services and the business logic behind them can be customized through \n\t\tthe Development Console.\n",
