  "description": "    Designers love to make beautifully custom page controls that fit in with all the wood,\n    gradients, and inner shadows they've worked so hard perfecting.\n\n    Who can blame them?! SMPageControl makes it dead simple to give them what they want. Even\n    better, SMPageControl is a drop in replacement for UIPageControl. It mirrors all the functions\n    of UIPageControl, with literally no changes beyond the class name.\n",
