  "description": "Current design trends require complex designs which allow horizontal scrolling inside vertical scrolling. So to show the users that they can scroll vertically, a peeking item should be shown on the side. This library does exactly that.\nI wrote this library because there's no pod that does this simple feature. Also, other libraries require me to inherit from a UICollectionViewController, which doesn't give alot of freedom if I'm inheriting from other View Controllers.",
