  "summary": "A lightweight library that streamlines interaction with the Firebase/Auth library on iOS, written in Swift.",
  "description": "The primary motivation of this library is to make building custom UI around the Firebase Authentication\nservice easier on iOS for those of us that do not want to use the FirebaseUI library. It does this by\nimplementing standard authentication workflows and error handling (i.e. account linking, profile updates,\nset/update password, reauthentication, enable/disable thrid-party identity providers, account deletion,\nauto-retry, etc.). This is done by abstracting away a lot of the error handling logic into a singleton\nstate machine (called AuthManager) capable of handling most Firebase authentication use cases.",
