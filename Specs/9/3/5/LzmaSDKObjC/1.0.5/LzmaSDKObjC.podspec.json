  "description": "It's not yet another wrapper around C part of the LZMA SDK with all it's limitations.\nBased on C++ LZMA SDK version 15.14 (1514 - latest for now) and patched for iOS & MacOS platforms.\nThe main advantages is:\n- List, extract 7z files (Lzma & Lzma2 compression method).\n- List, extract encrypted (password protected) 7z files (Lzma & Lzma2 compression method).\n- List, extract encrypted (password protected) + encrypted header (no visible content, files list, without password) 7z files (Lzma & Lzma2 compression method).\n- Manage memory allocations during listing/extracting.\n- Tuned up for using less than 500Kb for listing/extracting, can be easly changed runtime (no hardcoded definitions).\n- Manage IO read/write operations, aslo can be easly changed runtime (no hardcoded definitions).\n- Track smoothed progress, which becomes possible with prev.\n- Support reading archive files with size more than 4GB and extracting files with size more than 4GB eg.
