  "description": "                    JsonSwiftson is a helper class for parsing JSON text and mapping it to Swift types.\n\n                    The goals of this project:\n\n                    * Map JSON text into Swift structures or classes.\n                    * Keep the library tiny by using Swift generics and taking advantage of type casting features of the language.\n                    * Expose just a single API method `map()` to handle strings, numbers, booleans and arrays of those types.\n                    * Support casting to optional types.\n                    * Check if the mapping was successful.\n                    * Make sure mapping is fast.\n",
