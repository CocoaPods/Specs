  "description": "Seam3 is a framework built to bridge gaps between CoreData and CloudKit. It handles almost all of the CloudKit hassle.\nAll you have to do is use it as a store type for your CoreData store.\nLocal caching and sync is taken care of.\nIt builds and exposes different features to facilitate and give control to the developer where it is demanded and required.\n\nSeam3 is based on [Seam](https://github.com/nofelmahmood/Seam) by [nofelmahmood](https://github.com/nofelmahmood/)\n\nChanges in Seam3 include:\n\n* Corrects one-to-many and many-to-one relationship mapping between CoreData and CloudKit\n* Adds mapping between binary attributes in CoreData and CKAssets in CloudKit\n* Code updates for Swift 4.2\n* Restructures code to eliminate the use of global variables",
