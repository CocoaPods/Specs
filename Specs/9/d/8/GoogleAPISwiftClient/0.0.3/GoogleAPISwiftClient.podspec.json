  "summary": "A Google API Client for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch in 2015",
  "description": "                   A lot of us probably use at least one of Google's public data APIs, and those of us using Cocoa and Cocoa Touch are directed to the open-source [Google APIs Objective-C Client](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-objectivec-client/) for implementation help.\n                   It was good for what it was in 2011, but that was before Swift, modern Objective-C, CocoaPods, and even Automatic Reference Counting! Some things in life age well; that library is not one of them. And Google hasn't helped by basically ignoring their client library in these ways.\n                   That's why I decided I would try something new. Something that would actually utilize current technologies. Something that would be actually nice for devs to use.\n                   I couldn't find what I was looking for, so I decided to build it myself.\n                   This current version only contains the base model and fetcher classes and protocols. I have another branch set up for the first service to be implemented, which is Blogger.\n",
