  "description": "Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the centre. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content. \nIn a world where content is consumed via countless channels and form factors across mobile, web and IoT. Contentstack reimagines content management by decoupling code from content. Business users manage content – no training or development required. Developers can create cross-platform apps and take advantage of a headless CMS that delivers content through APIs. With an architecture that’s extensible – but without the bloat of legacy CMS – Contentstack cuts down on infrastructure, maintenance, cost and complexity.",
