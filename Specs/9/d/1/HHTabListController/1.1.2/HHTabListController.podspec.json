  "description": "                   HHTabListController is an implementation of a tab controller where tabs are listed in a table view hidden behind the active view controller. The list of tabs may be revealed using a swipe gesture or by touching a button.\n\nVisually the implementation is similar to the sliding menu or navigation bar seen in many iOS applications. To my knowledge the idea was pioneered by the Facebook app.\n\nThe HHTabListController implementation was written for the [ACTPrinter 4.0 application](https://itunes.apple.com/app/actprinter-virtual-printer/id296083171?mt=8).\nThe code presented here is identical to the one used in the shipped product.\n",
