  "description": "ASUserDefaults is an NSUserDefaults wrapper written for Swift 2.0.\nYou may be asking yourself the following question: \"why does NSUserDefaults need a wrapper?\" \nWhile NSUserDefaults is already a simple to use API, I found myself still occasionally needing to look up the documentation for it.\nWhat ASUserDefaults aims to do is simplify your NSUserDefaults flow by simply calling a `Save` and `Load` method on the ASUserDefaults shared manager (singleton) class.\nBeyond this simplification, ASUserDefaults offers a delegate that notifys delegators of when an object is being saved/loaded and its key.\nThe ASUserDefaults pod project includes an example project and tests.\nFeel free to offer a PR or comment on whether you think this project is useful or not.\n\nEnjoy!",
