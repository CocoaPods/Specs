  "summary": "Makes Internet connectivity detection more robust by detecting Wi-Fi networks without Internet access.",
  "description": "Connectivity wraps Apple's Reachability code to provide a reliable measure of whether Internet connectivity is available where Reachability alone can only indicate whether _an interface is available that might allow a connection_. Connectivity's objective is to solve the captive portal problem whereby an iOS device is connected to a Wi-Fi network lacking Internet connectivity. Such situations are commonplace and may occur for example when connecting to a public Wi-Fi network which requires the user to register before use. Connectivity can detect such situations enabling you to react accordingly.",
