  "description": "\"A Promise represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created.\nIt allows to associate handlers to an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure\nreason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the\nfinal value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point in the\nfuture.\"",
