  "summary": "This is NDN-CXX equivalent implementation in Swift on the iOS platform",
  "description": "This implementation is based on NDN-CXX, but written in Swift for the iOS platform developers. Different than other platforms, there is no NFD running in the background, so a developer should specify forwarder's IP address when creating a face. The details can be found in the example. Also, it requires further efforts on implementing security parts that are not yet implemented since the main focus for now is data transmission.",
