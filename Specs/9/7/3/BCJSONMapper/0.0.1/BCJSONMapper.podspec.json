  "description": "BCJJSONContinuations is a library for processing the crazy JSON structures that exist in the real world. Its key features are:\n+ Flexible. Provides functionality for handling many JSON usage styles.\n+ Extensible. Easy to integrate new processing (e.g. peculiar date formats).\n\n                   * Think: Why did you write this? What is the focus? What does it do?\n                   * CocoaPods will be using this to generate tags, and improve search results.\n                   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.\n                   * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!\n",
