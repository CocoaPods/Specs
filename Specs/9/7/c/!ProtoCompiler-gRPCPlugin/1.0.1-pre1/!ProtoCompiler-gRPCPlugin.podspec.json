  "description": "This podspec only downloads the gRPC protoc plugin so that local pods generating protos can use\nit in their invocation of protoc, as part of their prepare_command.\nThe generated code will have a dependency on the gRPC Objective-C Proto runtime of the same\nversion. The runtime can be obtained as the \"gRPC-ProtoRPC\" pod.",
