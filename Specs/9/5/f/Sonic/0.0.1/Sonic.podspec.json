  "description": "        Sonic is a simple algorithm for speeding up or slowing down speech.\n        However, it's optimized for speed ups of over 2, unlike previous\n        algorithms for changing speech rate. The Sonic library is a very simple\n        ANSI C library that is designed to easily be integrated into streaming\n        voice applications, like TTS back ends.\n",
