  "description": "An elegant way to handling pop gesture recogenizer event. Have you ever had such a problem? The screen-edge-pan gesture recognizer is invalid when you custom the `leftNavigationItem`. When you want to make user confirm whether to popToSuperViewController or not, you should prevent the pop and present a `UIAlertController'. Now you can implement them with a little bit of code.",
