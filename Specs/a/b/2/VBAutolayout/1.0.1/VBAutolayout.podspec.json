  "description": "There are developers (like me) who prefer to create UI programmatically due to numerous reasons. I use storyboards for segues and user scene-path. But UIViewControllers are left empty. And I do not use xibs.\n\nWhen you create adaptive UI programmatically the view (or viewcontroller) code becomes unreadable because of big autolayout creation calls.\n\nVBAutolayout is a library which makes programmatic autolayout creation comfortable, readable and code-minimized.",
