  "description": "The Soneso iOS and macOS Stellar SDK facilitates integration with the Stellar Horizon API server and submission of Stellar transactions, either in your iOS or macOS app. It has two main uses: querying Horizon and building, signing, and submitting transactions to the Stellar network. The SDK gives you access to all the endpoints exposed by Horizon. Using Horizon, many requests can be invoked in streaming mode. All available streaming endpoints are covered by the SDK and you can use the SDK streaming functions to listen for updates. The SDK also covers encoding and decoding of all XDR Objects available.",
