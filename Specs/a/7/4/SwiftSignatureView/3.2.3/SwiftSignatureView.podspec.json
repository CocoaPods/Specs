  "description": "SwiftSignatureView is a lightweight, fast and customizable option for capturing signatures within your app. You can retrieve the signature as a UIImage. With code that varies the pen width based on the speed of the finger movement, the view generates fluid, natural looking signatures. *And now, with iOS13+, SwiftSignatureView automatically uses PencilKit to provide a native and even more fluid signature experience, including a natural integration with the Apple Pencil which makes SwiftSignatureView even better!*",
