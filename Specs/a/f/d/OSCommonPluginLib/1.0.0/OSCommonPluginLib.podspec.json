  "description": "This repository contains a protocol that interfaces business logic with iOS platform.\nDevelopers are able to create their own integrations of PlatformProtocol for their target mobile framework.\nThis structure allows us to develop native plugins, portable between techonological stacks (ie: Cordova, React-native, Flutter...).\nThe library is composed by two methods, each with its own purpose:\n- `sendResult(result, error, callBackID)` will send messages back to the caller mobile framework.\n- `trigger(event, data)` will trigger an event on the mobile framework's own webview.",
