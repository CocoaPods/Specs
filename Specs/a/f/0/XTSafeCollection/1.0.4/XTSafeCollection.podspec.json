  "description": "                   In Cocoa development, we often meet crashes like the follow:\n                   1. `[NSArray objectAtIndex:]` when index exceeds array bounds.\n                   2. `[NSMutableArray addObject]` when we attempt to add an nil Object.\n                   ...\n\n                   XTSafeCollection provide a way to avoid these crashes. Just add the `XTSafeCollection.h`, `XTSafeCollection.m` to you project,\n                   You event don't need to modify you codes, call the methods as what they are.\n\n                   More:https://github.com/wuwen1030/XTSafeCollection.\n\n",
