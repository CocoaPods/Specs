BindID uses FIDO-based biometrics for secure, convenient, and consistent passwordless authentication. This guide explains how to integrate BindID into your web application—including the changes required for your login page and backend application. Since BindID implements the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard, the integration steps are similar to other OIDC-based services like Sign in with Google.",
