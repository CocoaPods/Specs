  "description": "You know those moments in your app when you have a `UITableView` that has no rows to show? You know those moments when you perform a HTTP network request and you want to show a non-blocking loading view to the user? These are very common scenarios for mobile apps. Swapper is a `UIView` that allows you to swap between a set of other `UIView`s with just 1 line of code.",
