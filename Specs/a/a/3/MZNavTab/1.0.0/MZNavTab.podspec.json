  "description": "                   MZNavTab is a flexible and convenient iOS library to help you combine UITabBarController(It's UITabBar actually, or just a custom view which work like a tab bar) and UINavigationController. As an iOS developer, you may know that it's much more complex to combine UITabBarController and UINavigationController in your app, mostly we want to control the visibility of tab bar while we make a push or pop in navigation controller.\n",
