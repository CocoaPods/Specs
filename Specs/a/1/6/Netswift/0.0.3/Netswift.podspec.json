  "description": "Networking in Swift can be tedious from the get go if you're not too experienced. This is where Netswift aims to shine!\n\nThis framework was highly inspired by blog posts written by the brilliant John Sundell (https://www.swiftbysundell.com) and Ray Wenderlich (https://www.raywenderlich.com/).\n\nIt currently allows to (somewhat) easily write simple network calls in a very structured and maintainable way. It does so by using protocols with associated types & generic classes very extensively.",
