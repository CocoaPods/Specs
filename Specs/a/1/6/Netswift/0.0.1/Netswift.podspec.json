This is where Netswift aims to shine!\n\nThis framework was highly inspired by blog posts written by the brilliant John Sundell (https://www.swiftbysundell.com) and Ray Wenderlich (https://www.raywenderlich.com/).\n\nIt currently allows to (somewhat) easily write simple network calls in a very structured and maintainable way. It does so by using protocols with associated types & generic classes very extensively.",
