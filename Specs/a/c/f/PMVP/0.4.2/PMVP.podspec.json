  "description": "PMVP offers a comprehensive set of components for interacting with collections of \nobjects within any arbitrary domain object model. Built on industry standards and\nbest practices for data persistence, the data layer tools published here represent\na standard API for reading, updating, and deleting data. Moreover, the Provider\narchitecture aims to define a uniform mechanism for synchronizing data between\nlocal and remote persistent stores, all without sacrificing extensibility.\n\nBeyond the data layer, PMVP aims to wrangle the often complex dance between data\nmodel objects and the UI components displaying information to the user. By adopting\nthe Reactive Extensions (Rx) design methodology, PMVP enables a unidirectional data\nflow all the way from database to UI, ready to react to any user intent.\n\nThis project would not be possible without the tireless dedication of the iOS team\nat Motiv in 2018. Antony Zhuang, Donny Kuang, and Mimi Chenyao played critical roles\nin the success of this effort. In the face of unfamiliar design patterns, with little \nto no exposure to Rx, they were able to adapt, refine, and champion the architecture. \n\nWe are proud of our 4.5 star rating, and we believe it demonstrates the awesome power \nof PMVP.",
