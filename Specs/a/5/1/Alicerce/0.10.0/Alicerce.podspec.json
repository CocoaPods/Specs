  "description": "Ever felt that you keep repeating yourself every time you start a new project? That you would like to have all those useful utils and helpers you love already available? We felt that way too! Thus, Alicerce was born. 🏗\n\nAlicerce is a framework that aims to serve as a starting point for iOS applications, by providing the foundations for many of the common functionalities a modern application requires, as well as be a repository for those small utils and helpers that make our life easier.\n\nIt is designed with an MVVM architecture in mind, but you'll find most components are architecture agnostic.",
