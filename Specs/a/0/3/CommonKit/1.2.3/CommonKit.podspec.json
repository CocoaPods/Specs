  "summary": "A Swift framework with some common extensions and functions",
  "description": "Various extensions and functions. Some are written by me, some are\ncollected online. And some are variations. This framework is supposed\nto give you a faster start with your project by combining some useful\nand often used code. Includes few UI classes extending UILabel as well\nsince extensions for UILabel could not provide this functionality.\n\nAlso I have merged my LocaleKit support to this framework. LocaleKit allows\none to define App wide fixed locale and has some extensions as well.\n\nThis framework is base for many of my other frameworks, so some of my other\nwork is dependant of this.",
