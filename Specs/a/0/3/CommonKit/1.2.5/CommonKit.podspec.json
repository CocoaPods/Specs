This framework is supposed\nto give you a faster start with your project by combining some useful\nand often used code. Includes few UI classes extending UILabel as well\nsince extensions for UILabel could not provide this functionality.\n\n - Merged: LocaleKit support. LocaleKit allows a fixed App wide locale to be defined.\n - Merged: NumPad. NumPad for both iPhone and iPad, also with phone style keypad.",
