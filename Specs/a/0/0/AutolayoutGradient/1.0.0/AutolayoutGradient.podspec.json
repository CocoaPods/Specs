  "description": "Problem: Applying a color gradient as the background of a UIView WITHOUT replacing the view's layer means that as soon as the view's bounds change (because of autolayout) the gradient DOES NOT update accordingly.\nSolution: This lib adds a simple way to ensure the applied gradient updates as expected when a view's bounds are changed.",
