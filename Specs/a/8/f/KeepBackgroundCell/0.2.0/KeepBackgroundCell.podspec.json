  "description": "Whenever a UITableViewCell is selected or highlighted, it automatically sets the \nbackgroundColors of all its subviews to transparent. This makes sense for many views,\nsuch as UILabels to allow the selectedBackgroundView to show through inbetween the\nindividual letters.\n\nHowever with custom views, there are many cases where the backgroundColor should be \nmaintained on selection of highlighting of the cell.\n\nKeepBackgroundCell provides a way to turn of this transparency \"feature\" on individual \nUITableViewCells.",
