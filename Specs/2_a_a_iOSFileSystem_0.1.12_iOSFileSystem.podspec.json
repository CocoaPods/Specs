  "summary": "Interact with the iOS file system in a protocol oriented way.",
  "description": "Written in Swift 4.2 the library is based off two main protocols. `Directory` and `File`. You can now build up references to files and directories by conforming to the protocol. \n\nI provide `Directory` structs for most of the common directories in the sandbox. I also provide a `File` struct for `.png` and `.jpg` files both to serve as an example and to cover you for these two common file types.",
