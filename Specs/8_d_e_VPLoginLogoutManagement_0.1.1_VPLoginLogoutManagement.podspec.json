  "description": "I allow users to login/logout using email/password, facebook, twitter, google in all my apps. I have found out that UserDefaults is the easist way to maintain the state of the user (if they are logged in when they come back to the App). I would present them a different view if they are already logged-in and if they aren't I would usually take then to the sign-in/sign-up page.",
