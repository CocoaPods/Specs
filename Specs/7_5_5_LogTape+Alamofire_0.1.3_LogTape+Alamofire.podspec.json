  "description": "LogTape makes it easier for you diagnose what went wrong in your app. Shake your device when something looks odd and inspect network calls, screenshot and recorded videos at a later date. This pod integrates LogTape with Alamofire.\n\nMakes it a lot easier to deal panicked testers that want to show you a rare bug that's super tough to reproduce. You can quickly deduce if it's backend related without having to plug in a device, log in with the same user, try to reproduce the same flow and so on. You won't have to interrupt your current flow to investigate.\n\nThe logs are stored on https://www.logtape.io in precise detail that's easy to follow. Inspect headers, response times, payloads, status codes and so on. \n\nOnce your team integrates the tool into the day-to-day workflow it's great to include a link to a log from a JIRA issue and so on.",
