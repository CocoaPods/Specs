  "description": "Lookback is a tool and library for user experience testing\nthat you can integrate into your app. Lookback records the\niOS screen, the front-facing camera, microphone, metadata,\ntouches and active views, and uploads it all in\nnear-realtime to lookback.io where you can study and dive\ninto the data. Example use cases:\n\n* User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your\ntesting lab to record both the screen and your tester's\nreactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.\n* Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of\nusing your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring\nproblems.\n* Quality assurance. Record videos of found bugs, complete\nwith a trace of how the tester reached it.\n\nUse this version of Lookback in versions of your app that you\ndebug with or submit to testers, but not to Appstore: your app\nwill be rejected. See the pod LookbackSafe for a version you\ncan use in the AppStore.\n\nSee some more examples over at http://lookback.io/examples.",
