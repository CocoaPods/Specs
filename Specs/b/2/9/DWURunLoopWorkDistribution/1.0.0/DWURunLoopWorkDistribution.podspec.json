Step aside when UI thread gets busy.\n* If deployed properly, it could:\n*** Delay heavy tasks on the UI thread as late as possible.\n*** Preload heavy tasks as soon as the UI thread enters its idling mode.\n*** Allow you to distribute a heavy task as multiple smaller tasks, thus less blocking when UI thread suddenly gets busy again.\n* 100% thread safe. Always runs on the UI thread.",
