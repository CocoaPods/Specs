  "description": "JOCircularSlider is a highly customisable and reusable iOS circular slider that mimics the behaviour of a knob control. It uses no preset images and every one of its components is drawn completely in code making it extremely adaptable to every design and theme.\nIt's written in Swift 4.2 and it's 100% IBDesignable and all parameters are IBInspectable.\nYou can control almost every aspect of the slider's design: Size, colors, direction (clockwise/anti-clockwise), etc...",
