  "description": "Creating transitions with a great user experience on iOS require a lot of work. Many protocols to implement, many animations to create and it usually ends up in a code mess which cannot be used in another transition or app. EasyTransitions library attempts to provide a few basic transitions in a simple way to implement and to extend so you can add incredible transitions with a few lines of code.",
