  "description": "Taps is a lightweight Unit Test library optimized for asynchronous code.\n  * As the generated output is TAP13 compatible, you can easily customize it yourself.\n  * Taps has been implemented using RxSwift and therefore you can easily test your own Observables with ease.\n  * You can either use Taps integrated TapsHarness or you can use the pod TestHarness to customize the output.",
