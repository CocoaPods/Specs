  "description": "XMPPFramework provides a core implementation of RFC-3920 (the xmpp standard), along with\n  the tools needed to read & write XML. It comes with multiple popular extensions (XEPs),\n  all built atop a modular architecture, allowing you to plug-in any code needed for the job.\n  Additionally the framework is massively parallel and thread-safe. Structured using GCD,\n  this framework performs    well regardless of whether it's being run on an old iPhone, or\n  on a 12-core Mac Pro. (And it won't block the main thread... at all). support the tream compression",
