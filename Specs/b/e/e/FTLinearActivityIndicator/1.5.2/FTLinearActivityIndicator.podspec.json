  "summary": "Add the missing network activity indicator on iPhone with notch",
  "description": "iPhones with a notch such as X, XS, XR, 11 (Pro), 12-13 (mini, Pro) don't display the\nnetwork activity indicator anymore. This pod brings it back by placing an activity\nindicator in the upper right of the screen on top of the regular status bar items.\nSince a circular indicator wouldn't fit, a rectangular \"KITT scanner\" like indicator\nwith a gradient is shown. The indicator UI can be used standalone or as a \"fix\" for\nthe iOS network activity indicator (using the existing API).",
