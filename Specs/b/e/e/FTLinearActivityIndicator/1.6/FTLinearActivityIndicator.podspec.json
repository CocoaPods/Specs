  "summary": "Add the missing network activity indicator on newer iPhones",
  "description": "iPhones with a notch such as X, XS, XR, 11 (Pro), 12-13 (mini, Pro) or Dynamic Island\nsuch as 14 Pro don't display the network activity indicator anymore. This pod brings it back\nby placing an activity indicator in the upper right of the screen on top of the regular\nstatus bar items. Since a circular indicator wouldn't fit, a rectangular \"KITT scanner\"\nlike indicator with a gradient is shown. The indicator UI can be used standalone or as a\n\"fix\" for the iOS network activity indicator (using the existing API).",
