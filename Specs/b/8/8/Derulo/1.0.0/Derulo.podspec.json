  "description": "Give your model objects a consistent JSON conversion / mapping / caching / offline strategy without getting in your way\n\nDesigned to be flexible enough to let you implement your models as your requirements dictate while giving you a general framework to organize your JSON parsing and caching strategy.\n\nA collection of composable but distinct features, so you can use the mixins that work for the use case at hand.\n\nSimple, straightforward, and lightweight; Derulo sits right between \"I'll just implement it myself without a third party library\" and \"I don't really want to reinvent the wheel and implement a JSON strategy from scratch\"",
