That version can be found here:https://www.cocoanetics.com/2009/12/how-to-make-a-pull-to-reload-tableview-just-like-tweetie-2/\n\nThe following is mostly their vanilla code. Though I did change a couple things, like changing the text to match what was in the previous version. Though, the Japanese text probably wasn't in Devin's original. :/\n\nI also overrode the setFrame function to center the text elements inside the frame. The activity view and arrow, I left as was.",
