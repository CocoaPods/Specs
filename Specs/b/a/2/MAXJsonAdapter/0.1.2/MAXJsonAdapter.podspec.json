  "description": "MAXJsonAdapter is intended for developers who want a simple, yet powerful, serialization and deserialization framework for JSON which does not require subclassing such as Mantle.\n\nSubclassing is a vital aspect of programming and most of the time we would like to have control over our root subclasses and not require third party subclasses which are out of our control. This project allows you to easily create model objects from json and vice versa.",
