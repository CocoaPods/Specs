  "description": "The AppController is a lightweight controller for managing transitions \nbetween \"unauthenticated\" and \"authenticated\" interfaces on iOS. Many apps \nimplement this lazily by presenting an authentication sheet above the main \napp interface. This is fine for some applications, however if you're looking\nfor something more robust, the structure implemented by AppController offers \na clean and clear separation of concerns between interfaces for each \nauthentication state. It manages interface transitions using Apple approved \nview controller containment API, and removes the unused view hierarchy from\nmemory once the transition is complete. By keeping your \"unauthenticated\" \nand \"authenticated\" view hierarchies completely separate, you can write cleaner \ncode and build more compelling onboarding experiences.",
