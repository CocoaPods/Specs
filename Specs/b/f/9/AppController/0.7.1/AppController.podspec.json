  "summary": "A simple controller that manages transitioning between \"signed out\" and \"signed in\" interfaces in iOS, written in Swift.",
  "description": "Modern iOS applications typically have the need to sign in. Many apps implement this lazily by presenting a login view controller above the main app interface. This project offers a cleaner alternative with a controller that can manage transitioning to/from the required interfaces. This approach means that the interface that is no longer being used can be completely deallocated from memory.",
