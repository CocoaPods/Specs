The category also includes a debugging extension that makes troubleshooting invalid constraints much easier and faster.\n\nIt is designed to be **as easy to use as possible to integrate and use** to speed up everyday development tasks. All the methods are well documented and described using doxygen style. \n\nFurthermore, the category comes along with **a small demo project** where you can see how to use helper methods for creating and debugging constraints.\n\n",
