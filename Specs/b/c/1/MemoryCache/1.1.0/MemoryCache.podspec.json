  "description": "MemoryCache is a memory cache class in swift.\n\n- The MemoryCache class incorporates **LRU** policies, which ensure that a cache doesn’t use too much of the system’s memory. If memory is needed by other applications, it removes some items from the cache, minimizing its memory footprint.\n- You can add, remove, and query items with **expiration** in the cache from different threads without having to lock the cache yourself. ( **thread-safe** )\n- Unlike the NSCache class, the cache guarantees a type by its key. ( **type-safe** )",
