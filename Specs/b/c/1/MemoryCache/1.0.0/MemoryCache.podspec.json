  "description": "MemoryCache is LRU, type-safe, thread-safe memory cache.\n - The MemoryCache class iincorporates **LRU** policies, which ensure that a cache doesn’t use too much of the system’s memory. If memory is needed by other applications, it removes some items from the cache, minimizing its memory footprint.\n - You can add, remove, and query items in the cache from different threads without having to lock the cache yourself.\n - Unlike the NSCache class, the cache guarantees a type by its key.",
