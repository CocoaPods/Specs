Here are some of the awesome things TLIndexPathTools does:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t* Organize data into sections with ease (now with blocks!)\n\t\t\t\t\t* Calculate and perform animated batch updates (inserts, moves and deletions)\n\t\t\t\t\t* Simplify data source and delegate methods via rich data model APIs\n\t\t\t\t\t* Provide a simpler alternative to Core Data NSFetchedResultsController\n\t\t\t\t\t* Provide base table view and collection view classes with advanced features\n\t\t\t\t\t\n0.3.1\n* Add all-inclusive header file `TLIndexPathTools.h`\n* Support (fix) multiple backing view controllers for cells\n* Detect and reload updated Core Data items\n* Improve general behavior of batch updates\n",
