  "description": "Adds many body particle physics simulation to a SpriteKit Scene targeted\nat supporting the display of a forced directed graph. It minimally interacts\nwith SpriteKit to apply a force to each body as an accumlated force from other\nnodes in the simulation, such that each node can still be subjected any other\nforces, collisions, and contacts in SpriteKit's physics simulation.",
