  "description": "ContainerViewControllers help you set up fast and easy ViewController hierachies.\nIt can be cumbersome to add viewControllers. The Interface builder is not your friend. Also setting up the viewControllers programatically is also cumbersome.\nIssues are also common with sizing and re-layouting.\nThis project offers some useful base viewControllers which extend the apple provided\ncontainer controllers nicely:\n* JMContainerViewController offers a simple base class to embed viewControllers.\n* JMStackContainerViewController allows you to stack multiple child containers vertically.\n* JMDocumentViewController adds a title bar above your content.\n\nAlso you can now establish viewController relationships directly with segues by using\n'JMEmbedSegue' or 'JMEmbedInDocumetSegue'. There are some manual steps neccessary, however I plan on implementing a interface builder rule to do these steps automatic.",
