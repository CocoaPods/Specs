  "description": "DEViewControllerCache is a cache system for iOS UIViewControllers. It automatically holds onto discarded UIViewController objects for later reuse and will purge unused controller objects according to NSCache memory considerations (including memory warnings). If a cached UIViewController instance is unavailable, it will automatically instantiate a new object and prepare it for caching.",
