  "summary": "Make atomic changes to object hierarchies",
  "description": "Transactions framework facilitates making atomic changes to the model:\n\n- It provides a generic mechanism to \"link\" coherent hierarchies of objects that are supposed to change their state synchronously and atomically.\n- It defines call-back functions that are triggered on every object at every transaction start, pre-commit integrity check, commit, and rollback.\n- It provides convenience method to wrap transactional code in closures. Such closures will be pre-pended by transaction start callbacks, post-pended by either commits or rollbacks, and will have an implicit integrity check ran for every member of the transaction context.\n\nThis approach allows to encapsulate constraints checking and backup/restore operations within each individual class, thus placing related code together and making the whole logic clearer and easier to maintain.",
