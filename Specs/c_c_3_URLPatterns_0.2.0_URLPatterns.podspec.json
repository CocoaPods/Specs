  "description": "URLPatterns is a small library to enable more idiomatic Swift pattern matching of URL path elements.\n`NSURL` is extended with the method `countedPathElements()`, which converts the URL's' array of path elements\ninto a `Counted` enum. Each case in `Counted` has a different number of associated values, which makes\npattern-matching each element easy, including wildcard, value-binding, begins and ends patterns.",
