  "description": "This is a CocoaPod that can be used for simple sentiment analysis of an English text. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a text. Simply put it tells you whether the text is \"happy\" or \"sad\".\n\nFor instance \"It was a good sunny day\" will score 2.0 points, meaning it is a positive text and \"It was rainy and cold day\" will be graded as negative.\n",
