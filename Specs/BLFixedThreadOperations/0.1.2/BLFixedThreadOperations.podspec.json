  "description": "A wrapper around NSThread to mimic NSOperationQueues, but make them work with a single thread.\nThe main purpose of this library is to create a familiar interface (based on NSOperations) to handle NSThreads. This is particularly handy when dealing with other non-thread-safe libraries that cannot be handled by dispatch queues or NSOperationQueues.",
