You can set custom label or use the defaults. McPicker can be presented as a Popover on iPhone or iPad using showAsPopover, as an inputView using McTextField or use the default slide up and down style show.\n\nshowAsPopover can be used to display from a UIView or UIBarButtonItem. showAsPopover will always be presented as a Popover, even when used on an iPhone.",
