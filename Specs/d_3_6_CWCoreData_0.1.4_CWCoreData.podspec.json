  "summary": "This is a small utility written in Swift to help you to use CoreData effectively throughout your app.",
  "description": "Using CWCoreData will make using core data in your app so much easier. It will initalise the database using the latest iOS 10 APIs or earlier APIs automatically for you. It will handle errors and bubble those back to you. It also adds extensions to NSManagedObject to allow easy insertions prior to iOS 10. It has quick APIs for database fetching too. It will also handle the creation of child contexts quickly and allow you to save them with or without a completion block. This completion block is invoked once the data has been saved back into the Persisten Store Coordinator.",
