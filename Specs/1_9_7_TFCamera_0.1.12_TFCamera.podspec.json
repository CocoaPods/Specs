  "description": "\"TFCamera is built off AVFoundation with speed and simplicity in mind. It doesn't have a lot of extra bells and whistles, but rather it strives to be a good starting point for any app that's in need of a quick camera component as a jumping off point. For now it includes the following features: pinch to zoom, tap to focus, double tap to swap cameras, hold shutter button to record video, selfie flash, and a basic shutter animation.\"",
