  "description": "                    TLLayoutTransitioning provides a `TLLayoutTransition` transition layout subclass and a `UICollectionView+TLTransitioning` category that combine to solve a couple of problems with layout transitions:\n\n                    1. `UICollectionViewLayoutTransition` does not handle content offset well, often leaving cells where you don't want them. `TLTransitionLayout` provides elegant control of content offset with Minimal, Center, Top, Left, Bottom or Right placement options relative to one or more index paths.\n\n                    2. `-[UICollectionView setCollectionViewLayout:animated:completion]` has [serious known bugs][3] in iOS7 and does not provide any animation options. TLLayoutTransitioning provides a robust alternative to this API with support for animation duration, 30+ easing curves and content offset control. This is done by using `CADisplayLink` to drive an interactive `TLTransitionLayout` as a non-interactive animation.\n\n                    Check out the demos in the Examples workspace!\n",
