  "description": "\t\t\t\t\tTLLayoutTransitioning solves two problems with collection view layout transitions:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The stock `UICollectionViewLayoutTransition` does not handle the content offset well, often leaving cells where you don't want them. `TLTransitionLayout` provides elegant control of the content offset relative to a specified cell or cells with Minimal, Center, Top, Left, Bottom and Right placement options.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The `-[UICollectionView setCollectionViewLayout:animated:completion]` method of animating between layouts is flakey (cells jumping, etc.) and there are no animation options. TLLayoutTransitioning can animate between two layouts with duration, 30+ easing curves and content offset control. This is done by combining `UICollectionViewLayoutTransition` with an automated `CADisplayLink` progress driver.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCheck out the demos in the Examples workspace!\n",
