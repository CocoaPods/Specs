  "description": "From the Haskell documentation on the Either type:\n\nThe Either type represents values with two possibilities: a value of type Either a b is either Left a or Right b.\n\nThe Either type is sometimes used to represent a value which is either correct or an error; by convention, the Left constructor is used to hold an error value and the Right constructor is used to hold a correct value (mnemonic: \"right\" also means \"correct\").",
