After proper configuration, this library\nallows the user to shake the phone to report bugs in the app. Very useful for clients who are not comfortable with using Github. After the phone is has been\nshaken, the library snapshots the current screen the user was on to aid in debugging. The user then is presented with a screen where he can enter the title of\nthe issue and a more detailed description. The user even has the option to add more images to upload with the issue.",
