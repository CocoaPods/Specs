  "description": "When you have a webservice to talk to parsing the data returned and handeling the errors can be a hassle. This is pod will help you build it more generic.\nWe use a single principle to build the the Architecture of this service. Your projects model object are of a certain Type. This Type can conform to `BaseModel` protocol so it can be saved or retreived by a `RequestController`.\n\nThe goal is to create a service layer for iCapps that is independent of any underlying frameworks or models you use (like pod `Argo` or `ObjectMapper`).",
