  "description": "Kingfisher is a lightweight and pure Swift implemented library for downloading and cacheing image from the web. It provides you a chance to use pure Swift alternation in your next app.\n* Everything in Kingfisher goes asynchronously, not only downloading, but also caching. That means you can never worry about blocking your UI thread.\n* Multiple-layer cache. Downloaded image will be cached in both memory and disk. So there is no need to download it again and this could boost your app dramatically.\n* Cache management. You can set the max duration or size the cache could take. And the cache will also be cleaned automatically to prevent taking too much resource.\n* Modern framework. Kingfisher uses `NSURLSession` and the latest technology of GCD, which makes it a strong and swift framework. It also provides you easy APIs to use.\n* Cancellable processing task. You can cancel the downloading or retriving image process if it is not needed anymore.\n* Independent components. You can use the downloader or caching system separately. Or even create your own cache based on Kingfisher's code.\n* Options to decompress the image in background before render it, which could improve the UI performance.\n* A category over `UIImageView` for setting image from an url directly.",
