  "description": "This framework provides the means for converting the numerical value of the time interval between two dates into a meaningful verbal form. Conversion occurs based on rules that are set by the user of the framework.\n\nThe framework contains:\n-  structure `NKTextTimeIntervalConfiguration`, which contains rules for converting a numerical value to a string format, performs transformations based on the specified rules;\n-  `TimeInterval` extension that computes the number of time components in the specified interval in the form of `Double` (`Double` is used instead of `Int` with the purpose that the user of the framework can independently set the rules for rounding or forming a line for fractional values);\n- `Date` class, which, based on date comparisons, generates a string representation of a time interval according to specified rules.",
