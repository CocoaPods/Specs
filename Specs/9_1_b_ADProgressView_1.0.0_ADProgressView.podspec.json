  "description": "I created this subclass after discovering that UIProgressView does not allow you to pause/continue its progression. Thanks to ADProgressView, you can now start/pause/continue/reset your progress view. A Timer instance is used to control the progression. You can also customize the time interval between each update, and of course the total duration.",
