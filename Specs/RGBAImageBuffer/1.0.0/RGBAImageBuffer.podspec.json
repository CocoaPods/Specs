  "description": "Get the UIColor of any pixel in a UIImage or CGImage relatively painlessly in Swift. Normally you have to interface with raw memory to accomplish this, and no one wants to do that. This makes it a (relatively) safe nullable subscript, rather than (relatively) unsafe pointer math.",
