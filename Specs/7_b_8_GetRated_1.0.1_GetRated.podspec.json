  "description": "GetRated is a handy class to help you promote your iPhone apps by using SKStoreReviewController in iOS 10.3 and later to prompt users to rate your app after using it for a few days. GetRated will then manage further attempts to get a rating by retrying periodically, in line with App Store recomendations. This approach is one of the best ways to get positive ratings by targetting only regular users (who presumably like the app or they wouldn't keep using it!).\n\nGetRated was inspired by, and in parts based on [iRate](https://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate) by Nick Lockwood.",
