  "description": "We are surrounded by highly-connected smart devices, interactive digital experiences and artificial intelligence. Yet, technology is not able to sense, analyze and adapt to human emotions. At Affectiva, we have made it our mission to bring emotional intelligence to the digital world. To make this mission a reality, we have created the Affdex SDK so that others can bring emotion sensing and analytics to their own offerings, be it digital experiences, apps, games, devices, or other technologies.\n\nUsing our SDK, developers can now enrich digital experiences and apps by detecting emotion. Devices can now instantly respond to a userâ€™s unfiltered emotions, and apps can adjust their interfaces and flow to better suit moods. This makes for a more authentic, interactive, and unique experience.",
