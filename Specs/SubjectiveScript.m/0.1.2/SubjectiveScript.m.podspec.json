So I wrote [Subjective-Script](https://github.com/kmalakoff/SubjectiveScript.m) and ported [QUnit.m](https://github.com/kmalakoff/QUnit.m) to end up with this:\n\n                      ```\n                      A* people = AO(OKV({@\"name\", @\"curly\"}, {@\"age\", N.I(50)}), OKV({@\"name\", @\"moe\"}, {@\"age\", N.I(30)}));\n                      people = _.sortBy(people, ^(O* person){ return person.get(@\"age\"); });\n                      equal(_.pluck(people, @\"name\").join(@\", \"), @\"moe, curly\", @\"stooges sorted by age\");\n                      ```\n\n                      Much better! And best of all, I can reuse my knowledge of JavaScript for function names so I can stop looking things up and get stuff done!\n",
