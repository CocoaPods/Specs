  "description": "SKBatcher intelligently loads, preloads, and caches content for cases where\na long list of items will be gradually viewed (e.g. scrolled) by a user. It\nis intended for cases where you have a group of objects on a server and need\nto obtain ancillary data for those objects to display in a UITableView,\nUICollectionView, etc. in an efficient manner.\n\nFor example, if a chat app needs to show a list of all of a user's chats,\nit can reduce server load and increase user responsiveness by using one or\nmore SKBatchers to manage loading the chat content for only the chats that\nare being shown, will likely be shown soon, or have already been shown.",
