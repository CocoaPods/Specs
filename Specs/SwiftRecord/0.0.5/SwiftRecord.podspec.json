Necessary for any and every Core Data project.\n\nWritten purely in Swift and based heavily on [ObjectiveRecord](https://github.com/supermarin/ObjectiveRecord)\n\nThis library also reads in your json dictionaries for you. Includes automatic camelCase changing ie `first_name` from server to `firstName` locally. You can customize the dictionary mapping to, read the mapping section. Relationship objects are also generated, but disabled by default. Set `SwiftRecord.generateRelationships` to true to enable this feature",
