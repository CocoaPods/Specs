  "summary": "A way to set custom fonts on UI elements in interface builder.",
  "description": "When using a font outside those that are built into iOS, it's often necessary\nto set fonts on labels, buttons, and text fields programatically. There are\nmany solutions to this, including subclassing, categories, or utility classes. \nIt would be cleaner if interface builder allowed you to set custom fonts directly\nin the nib or storyboard. With IPCustomFont, you can leverage the \"User-defined runtime\nattributes\" in interface builder's identity inspector to do just that.\n",
