  "summary": "BorderLabelTextField is a subclass of UITextField that adds a label above the input that breaks the border of the UITextField.",
  "description": "Space remains a crucial aspect in mobile Apps.\nWhile a label that shifts up or disappears when the TextField is selected works, it somehow limits the value of labels.\nUsing a label that sits right between the border of the TextField itself consumes less space\nand makes the label visible at any time, without drawing too much attention from the user,\nsince there is no unnecessary animation required for the label which improves overall UX.",
