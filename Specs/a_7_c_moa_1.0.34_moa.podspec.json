  "description": "                   Moa is an image download library for iOS written in Swift.\n                   It allows to download and show an image in UIImageView by setting its moa.url property.\n\n                   * Images are downloaded asynchronously.\n                   * Uses NSURLSession for networking and caching.\n                   * Images are cached locally according to their HTTP response headers.\n                   * Can be used without UIImageView.\n                   * Provides closure properties for image manipulation and error handling.\n",
