  "description": "The goal of this project is to maintain an API-compatible port of SwiftNIO's Future and Promise implementation for use in iOS \n(and macOS) projects, until Swift gets a superior form of concurrency, i.e. coroutines, or async await.\n\nUntil then, SwiftNIO's implementation of Promises can be considered Apple's first and only santioned implementation of the \nwell-known concurrency pattern for Apple platforms.",
