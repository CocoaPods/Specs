  "description": "This superclass makes it easier to handle the user's preferences (app's settings). It's intended to be used in iOS primarily.\nA successor to this class keeps the app settings in properties and stores itself in the defaults system. Although the settings values will not be accessible through the NSUserDefaults class directly, but only via the setters and getters of the VRAppSettings successor.\nThat gives common place for app's setting definition. The possibility to make range and consistency checks of the setting values in setters and getters. The refactoring tool can be used to change the setting's name across the project.",
