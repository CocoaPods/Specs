  s.description  = <<-DESC
                   DLColorPicker is a loose collection of UIControlsâ€¦
                   
                   DLCPHexPicker
                   DLCPHuePicker
                   DLCPBrightnessPicker
                   DLCPAlphaPicker
                   DLCPSaturationBrightnessPicker
                   DLCPHueSaturationPicker

                   As each one of the pickers isn't that usefull on its own, **DLColorPicker** also includes a pair of **UIViewControllers**:

                   * `DLCPGradientColorPickerController` (as seen on the left in the preview)
                   * `DLCPWaterfallColorPickerController` (as seen on the right in the preview)

                   Don't want a hex picker? No problem: Just don't add it to your view then. ;) Same for alpha, etc.

                   ## Features

                   * **Six picker controls** to choose from.
                   * **Two picker controllers** to choose from.
                   * **No image resources required**.
                   * **Animates** on color change.
                   * **Custom layout** (frames, sizes, positions, etc)
                   * **Custom appearance** (borders, shadows, etc.)
