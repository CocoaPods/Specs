  s.description  = <<-DESC
                   Objective-C's switch statements only work on primitive types that are constant at compile time.
                   However, many Objective-C APIs expect the developer to determine their behaviour based on identifiers passed in as NSString.
                   To deal with this, HCObjectSwitch adds a simple syntax that is very similar to the native switch statement.
                   In order to avoid clashing with the native syntax, all keywords start with a capital letter.
