                     JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
                     It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

    # jsoncpp is designed to be "amalgamated" for deployment, but some of the
    # paths in this version of amalagamate.py are incorrect, we need to fix
    # them first:
    perl -pi -e 's/lib_json\\\\/lib_json\\//g' amalgamate.py

    # Run amalgamate.py to combine the jsoncpp files and output them to the
    # 'dist' directory:
    python amalgamate.py

    # The generated json.h does not have the 'JSON_IS_AMALGAMATION' define
    # uncommented as it should be, lets do that now:
