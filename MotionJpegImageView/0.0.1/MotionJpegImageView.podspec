  s.description  = <<-DESC
                      MotionJpegImageView creates a connection to the stream
                      and receives JPEG frames one at a time over the network.
                      It turns out this approach is typically seven or eight
                      times faster than using UIWebView to render MJPEG
                      streams.

                      Just provide a URL for the video stream and you're good.
                      Internally, MotionJpegImageView achieves better
                      performance by avoiding overheads of parsing and
                      rendering each frame as if it were a web page which
                      UIView does.

                      Internally, MotionJpegImageView creates a connection to
                      the stream and receives frames one at a time over the
                      network. As it receives each frame, it hydrates the
                      stream data into a UIImage object, and then sets its
                      inherited image property. Thus the only bottlenecks
                      to getting high framerates are:

                      1. The speed of your network connection
                      2. The frame rate of the IP camera
                      3. The phoneâ€™s ability to process inbound packets and
                      rehydrate UIImage files from raw JPEG data.
