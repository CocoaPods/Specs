                    MTStackableNavigationController aims to be an API-compatible replacement for
                    UINavigationController, with special sauce for Facebook / Path style stacked
                    navigation. In contrast to most of the other view controller projects based on
                    this paradigm, MTStackableNavigationController is targeted exclusively for use
                    as a direct replacement for UINavigationController; layered navigation and deck
                    style interaction are already done well by other controllers.
