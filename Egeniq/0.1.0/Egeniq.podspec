  Egeniq Library for iOS projects
  ===============================

  This project contains some of the utility classes we've developed to make our lives easier. If they make our lives easier, they may also make somebody else happy, so we've decided to make them publicly available.

  As-is, no warranties whatsoever, use at your own risk, etc. etc.

  Pull requests with improvements are very much appreciated!

  Todo:
  * Overview of what's in here and what you'd use it for
  * Clean up documentation (especially headers)

  Note: 
  * We're gradually introducing stuff that requires iOS5. For projects that still need to support iOS4, use the 'ios4' branch.

  Have fun!
