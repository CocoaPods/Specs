                    **What is the Open Device Identification Number?**

                    The Open Device Identification Number (ODIN) is a number designed for mobile app developers and service providers to uniquely identify their users’ devices in a convenient and interoperable manner. Unlike existing device identification schemes, ODIN is:

                    - **Anonymous** A device’s ODIN does not encode any additional information beyond differentiating it from other ODINs. Having a single ODIN does not reveal any information about the originating device’s user, make, model, etc.
                    - **Consistent** ODIN provides a standardized format for identifying devices regardless of software platform. Thus iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and future devices all use the same number format.
                    - **Secure** The ODIN specification considers device identifiers to be personal information and details precautions in its transport accordingly. Additionally, even if the identifier were to be captured no additional information would be revealed beyond a unique number.

                    Maintenance of ODIN is administered by an ODIN Working Group (http://www.odinmobile.org) comprised of industry developers and service providers.
